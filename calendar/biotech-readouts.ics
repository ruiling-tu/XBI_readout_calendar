 up of disorders that gradually affect the ability of a person's bone marro
 w (semi-liquid tissue present in many bones like backbones) to produce nor
 mal blood cells. Some people with MDS have a risk of the disease progressi
 ng to acute myeloid leukemia (AML)\, and a risk of death from the disease 
 itself. Symptoms of MDS include fatigue\, shortness of breath\, unusual pa
 leness due to anemia (low red blood cell count)\, easy or unusual bruising
 \, and red spots just beneath the skin caused by bleeding. The purpose of 
 this study is to see how safe and effective venetoclax and azacitidine (AZ
 A) combination are when compared to AZA and a placebo (contains no medicin
 e)\, in participants with newly diagnosed higher-risk MDS. Venetoclax is a
 n investigational drug being developed for the treatment of MDS. The study
  consists of two treatment arms - In one arm\, participants will receive v
 enetoclax and AZA. In another arm\, participants will receive AZA and plac
 ebo. Adult participants with newly diagnosed higher-risk MDS will be enrol
 led. Around 500 participants will be enrolled in approximately 220 sites w
 orldwide. Participants in one arm will receive oral doses of venetoclax ta
 blet and intravenous (infusion in the vein) or subcutaneous (given under t
 he skin) AZA solution. Participants in another arm will receive oral doses
  of placebo tablet and intravenous or subcutaneous AZA solution. There may
  be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to the
 ir standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the co
 urse of the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment wil
 l be checked by medical assessments\, blood and bone marrow tests\, checki
 ng for side effects\, and completing questionnaires.\nClinicalTrials.gov:

 limab (also called REGN3767) with two other medications called cemiplimab 
 and platinum-doublet chemotherapy\, individually called a "study drug" or 
 collectively called "study drugs"\, when combined in this study. The study
  is being conducted in patients who have resectable stage II to IIIB (N2) 
 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that can be treated with surgery. The a
 im of the study is to see how effective the combination of fianlimab\, cem
 iplimab\, and chemotherapy is in comparison with cemiplimab and chemothera
 py as peri-operative therapy in participants with NSCLC. The study is look
 ing at several other research questions\, including: What side effects may
  happen from taking the study drugs How much of each study drug is in the 
 blood at different times Whether the body makes antibodies against the stu
 dy drugs (which could make the drugs less effective or could lead to side 
 effects) How administering the study drugs might affect quality of life\nC

 olizumab works alone or in combination with etrumadenant or tocilizumab in
  treating men with localized prostate cancer before radical prostatectomy.
  Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies\, such as atezolizumab\, may hel
 p the body's immune system attack the cancer\, and may interfere with the 
 ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Androgens can cause the growth 
 of prostate cancer cells. IL-6 is expressed by prostate cancer and within 
 the tumor microenvironment and shown to enhance prostate cancer and diseas
 e progression. Treatment with an anti-IL-6 antibody such as tocilizumab ma
 y inhibit cancer progression. Giving atezolizumab in combination with etru
 madenant or tocilizumab may work better in treating prostate cancer.\nClin

 n regular maintenance dosing of nusinersen (12 milligrams \\[mg\\] dose) e
 very 4 months\, with 4 months (± 2 weeks) between the LP-delivered study d
 ose and the last nusinersen dose prior to study enrollment. Participants m
 ust be enrolled in the PIERRE study to be eligible for enrolment in the PI
 ERRE PK study. Key Exclusion Criteria: Ongoing participation or participat
 ion within 6 months or 5 half-lives of the agent (whichever is longer) of 
 enrollment in...\nSummary: In this PIERRE-PK study\, researchers will lear
 n how the body processes nusinersen when it is given through the ThecaFlex
  DRx™ System\, compared to when nusinersen is given by lumbar puncture (LP
 ). The ThecaFlex DRx system is an investigational implantable medical devi
 ce developed by Alcyone Therapeutics\, Inc. It consists of a catheter\, wh
 ich is a flexible tube\, connected to a port which is placed under the ski
 n. Alcyone Therapeutics\, Inc. has an ongoing study called PIERRE to test 
 the ThecaFlex DRx system. Participants with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) 
 in the PIERRE study may be enrolled in the PIERRE-PK study. The main objec
 tive of the PIERRE-PK study is to learn how the body processes nusinersen 
 when given by the ThecaFlex DRx system compared to a lumbar puncture. The 
 main questions researchers want to answer are: What is the highest amount 
 of nusinersen found in the blood after dosing? How much nusinersen is foun
 d in the blood over the first 24 hours after dosing? The PIERRE-PK study w
 ill be done as follows: Participants will be screened to check if they can
  join the study. The screening period will be up to 30 days for this study
  and may overlap with the PIERRE study. Participants will receive a dose o
 f nusinersen by lumbar puncture. The ThecaFlex DRx system will be implante
 d after the lumbar puncture\, as part of the PIERRE study. Participants wi
 ll receive a dose of nusinersen by the ThecaFlex DRx system\, as part of t
 he PIERRE study. Researchers will take blood samples before and after each
  dose. The last blood sample will be taken 24 hours after the dose. The to
 tal study duration for each participant in the PIERRE-PK study will be app
 roximately 5 months. This period will overlap with the participant's first
  5 months in the PIERRE study.\nClinicalTrials.gov: https://clinicaltrials

 ermine how well an FDA-approved drug\, dupilumab\, works to treat patients
  with severe strictures and active Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE). This is
  an open-label study\, meaning everyone in the study will receive dupiluma
 b. Participants will have a screening visit where they will complete surve
 ys and undergo an endoscopy (EGD). Blood and biopsies (small tissue sample
 s) will also be collected. If eligible and enrolled into the study\, parti
 cipants will receive weekly subcutaneous (under the skin) injections of du
 pilumab for 52 weeks (one year). The first dose of dupilumab will be admin
 istered in the clinic at the enrollment visit (day 0) and participants (or
  their caregivers) will receive training on how to self-administer the rem
 aining doses. Participants will return for study visits every at weeks 4\,
  8\, 12\, 18\, 24\, 30\, 36\, 44\, and 52. During these visits\, vital sig
 ns (temperature\, heart rate\, etc.) will be collected and participants wi

 ary: Often when people with asthma get a virus caused by the common cold (
 rhinovirus)\, they also experience an increase or worsening of their asthm
 a symptoms. The purpose of this study is to see if the study medication du
 pilumab helps prevent those with mild to moderate asthma from having incre
 ased asthma symptoms\, after being exposed to an experimental rhinovirus i
 noculation. This is a study about dupilumab which is a drug approved by th
 e U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of moderate to sev
 ere asthma. Dupilumab is a medication that blocks pathways that cause asth
 matic inflammation in the lungs\, leading to symptoms and worsening lung f
 unction. During this study\, subjects will be given either dupilumab or pl
 acebo and will subsequently be exposed to the the "common" cold virus (rhi
 novirus). The virus that the investigators are using has been safely used 
 before in many studies like this involving thousands of volunteers\, and t
 he safe use of the virus in this research study has been reviewed by the F
 DA. The investigators will track asthma symptoms during the study with lun
 g function tests\, questionnaires\, specimen collection\, biomarkers\, and
  physical exams. For data analysis the investigators will assess the sampl
 es collected to determine changes in the treatment groups. The investigato
 rs will also asses the symptom scores and deviations from baseline measure
 s for lung function.\nClinicalTrials.gov: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study

 duces staphylococcus aureus — 16 weeks — To demonstrate that dupilumab red
 uces staphylococcus aureus (phyla firmicutes) abundance. The abundance of 
 Staph aureus will be determined using qPCR of the femA gene and compared a
 t baseline and after 16 weeks of dupilumab treatment. Statistical differen
 ces in the quantity of staph aureus (as ascertained by qPCR) will be deter
 mined utilizing data obtained from all subjects comparing data obtained at

 -microbial proteins (ß-defensins1-4) and cathelicidin LL-37. These paramet
 ers will be determined using quantitative PCR. In addition\, we will corre
 late improvements in microbial diversity/decreased staph abundance with cl
 inical improvements as assessed via questionnaires and objective/subjectiv
 e smell function and also as improvements in cellular/immune T2 inflammati
 on as assessed by reduced expression of T2 cytokines/chemokines and eosino

 y: ABBV-RGX-314 is being developed as a novel\, potential one-time gene th
 erapy treatment for the treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) with and wi
 thout Center-Involved Diabetic Macular Edema (CI-DME). DR is a chronic and
  progressive complication of diabetes mellitus. It is a sight-threatening 
 disease characterized in the early stages by neuronal and vascular dysfunc
 tion in the retina\, and later by neovascularization that leads to further
  deterioration of functional vision. Despite the availability of current t
 reatments\, diabetic retinopathy remains the leading cause of vision loss 
 in working-age adults\, those between the ages of 20 and 74. Existing trea
 tment with anti-VEGF agents\, although shown to be effective\, are limited
  by short therapeutic half-lives\, which then require frequent intravitrea
 l injections over the patient's lifetime\, resulting in increased risk of 
 associated adverse events and significant treatment burden. Due to the bur
 den of treatment\, patients often do not closely adhere to treatment regim
 ens and experience sub-optimal outcomes and a decline in vision.\nClinical

 cardiograms (ECGs) performed at screening and/or prior to administration o
 f initial dose of study drug 3. Is in good health based on laboratory safe
 ty testing obtained at the screening visit\, as described in the protocol 
 4. Normal aPTT\, normal PT\, and normal platelet counts...\nSummary: This 
 clinical research trial will evaluate the safety and tolerability of an ex
 perimental drug\, ALN-F1202\, in healthy participants. The purpose of this
  trial is to learn about how safe and tolerable the experimental drug is. 
 The trial is looking at several other research questions\, including: What
  side effects may happen from taking the experimental drug? How much exper
 imental drug is in the blood at different times? Whether the body makes an
 tibodies against the experimental drug (which could make the drug less eff
 ective or could lead to side effects). What is the best dose of the experi
 mental drug?\nClinicalTrials.gov: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT0666

 th...\nSummary: Patients with diabetic macular edema (DME) sometimes must 
 undergo vitrectomy surgery (PPV) for diabetic and non-diabetic related iss
 ues. Patients may have improved DME with anti-VEGF therapy and ranibizumab
  has been found to reduce central macular thickness (CMT) with anti-VEGF t
 herapy following vitrectomy. Those patients still require intravitreal inj
 ections but the pharmacokinetics of a vitrectomized eye are different than
  those eyes that have not undergone vitrectomy. The clearance of protein m
 olecules is quicker in vitrectomized eyes so these patients may be more re
 fractory to standard of care anti-VEGF therapy. In rabbit models\, the hal
 f-life of both bevacizumab and ranibizumab were reduced by a factor 1.8 an
 d 1.3\, respectively\, after pars plana vitrectomy. In a study examining i
 ntravitreal triamcinolone acetonide in human eyes\, the half-life was foun
 d to be 18.6 days in non-vitrectomized eyes and 3.2 days in vitrectomized 
 eyes\, but there was considerable intrasubject variation. Patients with va
 rious disease states\, including neovascular age-related macular degenerat
 ion (nAMD) have been managed with monthly anti-VEGF therapy successfully a
 fter vitrectomy surgery. Another study performed by the DRCR net showed th
 at patients with DME treated with anti-VEGF are not affected in the long t
 erm if they had had a previous vitrectomy. High dose aflibercept may impro
 ve anatomic and visual outcomes in this patient population. Also\, high do
 se aflibercept may allow for longer treatment intervals in these vitrectom
 ized eyes.\nClinicalTrials.gov: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT066629

 marlotamig (REGN7075) by itself and in combination with cemiplimab with or
  without chemotherapy. The study is focused on patients with certain solid
  tumors that are in an advanced stage. The aim of the study is to see how 
 safe and tolerable marlotamig is by itself and in combination with cemipli
 mab (with or without chemotherapy)\, and to find out what is the best dose
  of marlotamig to be given to patients with advanced solid tumors when com
 bined with cemiplimab (with or without chemotherapy). Another aim of the s
 tudy is to see how effective marlotamig by itself\, or in combination with
  cemiplimab (with or without chemotherapy)\, is at treating cancer patient
 s. The study is also looking at: Side effects that may be experienced by p
 eople taking marlotamig by itself and in combination with cemiplimab with 
 or without chemotherapy How marlotamig works in the body by itself and in 
 combination with cemiplimab with or without chemotherapy How much marlotam
 ig is present in the blood when given by itself and in combination with ce
 miplimab with or without chemotherapy To see if marlotamig by itself and i
 n combination with cemiplimab with or without chemotherapy works to treat 
 cancer by controlling the proliferation of tumor cells to shrink the tumor
  * Whether the body makes antibodies against the study drugs (marlotamig a
 nd cemiplimab) (which could make the drug less effective or could lead to 
 side effects)\nClinicalTrials.gov: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT046

 ge I-III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been established as a stan
 dard of care and has improved treatment outcomes. However\, there is curre
 ntly no adequate method to determine which patients should receive these a
 djuvant therapies. Identifying those with a good prognosis without adjuvan
 t therapy could reduce the risk of adverse events\, lessen the burden of c
 linic visits\, and reduce healthcare costs. Among various approaches\, ctD
 NA-based MRD (minimal residual disease) analysis is highly anticipated and
  has already been introduced into clinical practice for hematologic malign
 ancies. However\, solid tumors' development as a companion diagnostic has 
 been limited\, and regulatory approval is mainly being considered based on

 x (cDLQI) it is a 10-item questionnaire that assesses six different aspect
 s that may affect quality of life\, including symptoms and feelings\, dail
 y activities\, leisure\, work and school performance\, personal relationsh
 ips\, and treatment. Each of the 10 questions is scored from 0 (not at all
 ) to 3 (very much) and the overall cDLQI is calculated by summing the scor
 e of each question\, resulting in a total score between 0-30. The higher t
 he score\, the more quality of life is impaired.\n- Participant-caregiver 
 assessment: Change from baseline in the Infant's Dermatology Life Quality 
 Index score — From baseline up to 24 months — The Infant Dermatology Quali
 ty of Life Index (iDLQI) contains 10 questions and a response scale divide
 d into four boxes. Each box gives a point between 0 and 3. The lower numbe
 r is understood as the most positive for the participant.\n\nThe index is 
 filled out by a parent to a participating child between the ages of 0 to 5
  years.\n\nPoints from each question are added together and the end-sum re
 presents the score. The sum score can be between 0 and 30. The higher the 
 score the worse the assumed quality of life.\n- Participant-caregiver asse
 ssment: Change from baseline in the Dermatitis Family Impact (DFI) questio
 nnaire — From baseline up to 24 months — The DFI is a 10-item disease spec
 ific questionnaire assessing the impact of having a child with AD on famil
 y Quality of Life (QoL). The DFI questions are scored ranging from 0 to 3\
 , and the total DFI score ranges from 0 to 30. The time frame of reference
  is the past week\, and a higher DFI score indicates greater impairment in
  family QoL as affected by AD.\n- Participant-caregiver assessment: Change
  from baseline in the patient's Worst Itch Numerical Rating Scale (WI-NRS)
  — From baseline up to 24 months — WI-NRS is a validated measure of itch s
 everity. Patients will be asked daily to rate the intensity of their worst
  pruritus (itch) over the past 24 hours\, using a 11-point scale ranging f
 rom 0 (no itch) to 10 (worst imaginable itch). Higher scores indicate more
  severity.\n- Caregiver assessment: Change from baseline in the patient's 
 Worst Itch Scale Numerical Rating Scale (WSI-NRS) — From baseline up to 24
  months — The WSI-NRS is a single-item caregiver-reported. The caregivers 
 describe their child "scratch" or "itch" in the AD-affected area by using 
 numeric response options (0: no scratching/itching to 10: worst scratching
 /itching). Higher scores indicate more severity.\n- Physician assessment: 
 Change from baseline in the eczema severity using the Eczema Area and Seve
 rity Index (EASI) — From baseline up to 24 months — The EASI is calculated
  by summing 4 separate scores of the (1) head/neck\, (2) upper extremities
 \, (3) trunk\, and (4) lower extremities. For each of the 4 anatomical reg
 ions\, the score formula is SxAxM \\["S" is the congregate score from the 
 severity of 4 signs: erythema\, oedema/papulation\, excoriation\, and lich
 enification graded on a discrete scale from 0 to 3\, where 0 = absent\, 1 
 = mild\, 2 = moderate\, and 3 = severe\, giving S a maximum of 12. "A" rep
 resents the area to which AD affects the body\, yielding a maximum of 6 po
 ints: 0 = 0%\, 1 = 1-9%\, 2 = 10-29%\, 3 = 30-49%\, 4 = 50-69%\, 5 = 70-89
 %\, and 6 = 90-100%. "M" is a multiplier\, which is 0.1\, 0.2\, 0.3\, and 
 0.4\, respectively\, for the region affected in those ≥8 years and 0.2\, 0
 .2\, 0.3\, and 0.3\, respectively\, for those \\<8 years. The final EASI s
 core is calculated based on the sum of the scores from the 4 anatomical re
 gions. A higher score means higher AD severity. Scores range from 0 (no di
 sease) to 72 (maximal disease severity).\n- Physician assessment: Percent 
 change from beseline in the Body Surface Area (BSA) (%) affected by AD — F
 rom baseline up to 24 months — BSA affected by AD disease will be assessed
  for each major section of the body (head\, neck\, anterior trunk\, back\,
  upper limbs\, lower limbs\, and genitals). It will be reported as a perce
 ntage of all major body sections combined.\n- Physician assessment: Change
  in Proportion of patients with Validated Investigator's Global Assessment
  (IGA) — From baseline up to 24 months — The IGA is an Investigator-comple
 ted assessment scale used to determine severity of AD and clinical respons
 e to treatment. It is based on a 5-point scale\, ranging from 0 (clear) to
  4 (severe).\n- Physician assessment: Change from baseline in Biomarkers —
  From baseline up to 24 months — Biomarker analysis will be performed\, if
  available\, in routine clinical practice and at routine visits\n- Number 
 of Adverse Events (AE) / Serious Adverse Events (SAE) / Adverse Event of S

 opulation: Sex: ALL\; Age: 18 Years to Not specified\; Healthy Volunteers:
  False\nPrimary Endpoints:\n- Efficiency of biopsies — 3 years — The propo
 rtion of clinically indicated biopsies that show Active Rejection (AR) wil
 l be measured in the Prospera arm and the control arm. Specifically\, the 
 proportion of clinically indicated biopsies showing AR in individuals with
  a positive donor derived-cell free DNA dd-cfDNA test at the time of Bx in
  the test arm\, where Prospera has been integrated into the care paradigm\
 , will be compared against the proportion of clinically indicated biopsies
  showing AR in the control arm.\n- Graft function — 3 years — Graft functi
 on in the Prospera arm and control arm will be measured. This will be asse
 ssed by examining the average eGFR score (as calculated using serum creati
 nine Chronic Kidney Disease-EPIdemiology collaboration CKD\\_EPI equation)
  at year three in the Prospera arm compared to the average eGFR score dete
 rmined at year three in the historical control arm.\nSecondary Endpoints:\
 n- Evaluate the performance of Prospera — 5 years — The performance of Pro
 spera to detect AR will be evaluated. The sensitivity\, specificity\, Posi
 tive \\& Negative Predictive Value of the assay in sub-cohorts of patients
  will be calculated and compared to the performance of serum creatinine to
  detect AR in those cohorts.\n- Evaluate whether Prospera can detect acute
  rejection earlier than serum creatinine — 3 years — The grade of rejectio
 n observed in biopsies in the Prospera arm will be compared to the histori
 cal control arm which used serum creatinine.\n- Determine if and how Prosp
 era testing impacts patient care — 5 years — The proportion of Prospera as
 say results that doctors felt influenced their decisions around management
  of patients and biopsies will be calculated. This will be analyzed separa
 tely for the for-cause and protocol biopsies.\nEligibility Criteria (excer

 t...\nSummary: ABBV-RGX-314 (also known as RGX-314) is being developed as 
 a novel one-time gene therapy for the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-r
 elated macular degeneration (wet AMD). Wet AMD is characterized by loss of
  vision due to new\, leaky blood vessel formation in the retina. Wet AMD i
 s a significant cause of vision loss in the United States\, Europe and Jap
 an\, with up to 2 million people living with wet AMD in these geographies 
 alone. Current anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapies ha
 ve significantly changed the landscape for treatment of wet AMD\, becoming
  the standard of care due to their ability to prevent progression of visio
 n loss in the majority of patients. These therapies\, however\, require li
 fe-long intraocular injections\, typically repeated every four to 12 weeks
  in frequency\, to maintain efficacy. Due to the burden of treatment\, pat
 ients often experience a decline in vision with reduced frequency of treat
 ment over time. ABBV-RGX-314 is being developed as a potential one-time tr
 eatment for wet AMD.\nClinicalTrials.gov: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study

 storical recall...\nSummary: The goal of this clinical trial is to learn i
 f bitopertin works and is safe to treat EPP or XLP in participants 12 year
 s or older. The main questions it aims to answer are: Whether bitopertin i
 ncreases pain-free sunlight exposure after 6 months of treatment in partic
 ipants with EPP or XLP. How PPIX concentration levels change from before b
 itopertin treatment to after 6 months of treatment. Researchers will compa
 re bitopertin to a placebo look-alike substance that contains no drug. Par
 ticipants will complete daily questionnaires and attend study visits for a
 ssessments.\nClinicalTrials.gov: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06910

 at...\nSummary: ABBV-RGX-314 (also known as RGX-314) is being developed as
  a novel one-time gene therapy for the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-
 related macular degeneration (wet AMD). Wet AMD is characterized by loss o
 f vision due to new\, leaky blood vessel formation in the retina. Wet AMD 
 is a significant cause of vision loss in the United States\, Europe and Ja
 pan\, with up to 2 million people living with wet AMD in these geographies
  alone. Current anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapies h
 ave significantly changed the landscape for treatment of wet AMD\, becomin
 g the standard of care due to their ability to prevent progression of visi
 on loss in the majority of patients. These therapies\, however\, require l

 67\, also known as fianlimab (R3767)\, when combined with another medicati
 on called cemiplimab (each individually called a "study drug" or called "s
 tudy drugs" when combined) compared with cemiplimab alone. These types of 
 immunotherapy study drugs are collectively known as immune checkpoint inhi
 bitors. Immunotherapies are treatments that use the immune system to recog
 nize and kill cancer cells. The study is focused on participants with a ty
 pe of skin cancer known as melanoma. The objective of this study is to see
  if the combination of fianlimab and cemiplimab is an effective treatment 
 compared to cemiplimab in participants with high-risk\, resectable melanom
 a. Participants will receive treatment before surgery\, undergo resection\
 , and then will have the option to continue treatment after resection. The
  study is looking at several other research questions\, including: What si
 de effects may happen from receiving the study drug(s). How much study dru
 g(s) is in the blood at different times. Whether the body makes antibodies
  against the study drug(s) (which could make the drug less effective or co
 uld lead to side effects). Antibodies are proteins that are naturally foun
 d in the blood stream that fight infections. How administering the study d
 rugs might improve quality of life.\nClinicalTrials.gov: https://clinicalt

 Summary: This phase I/II study tests how well zimberelimab and quemliclust
 at work in combination with chemotherapy (mFOLFIRINOX) in treating patient
 s pancreatic adenocarcinoma that may or may not be able to be removed by s
 urgery (borderline resectable) or that has spread to nearby tissue or lymp
 h nodes (locally advanced). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies\, suc
 h as zimberelimab\, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer\, 
 and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Quem
 liclustat acts as a blocker for adenosine. Adenosine is a chemical produce
 d in the body that can lead to a decrease in the immune system's response 
 towards cancer. Quemliclustat has the potential to decrease the amount of 
 adenosine\, allowing the immune system to recognize and act against the ca
 ncer. Chemotherapy drugs\, such as oxaliplatin\, irinotecan\, leucovorin\,
  and fluorouracil\, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer ce
 lls\, either by killing the cells\, by stopping them from dividing\, or by
  stopping them from spreading. Giving chemotherapy in combination with zim
 berelimab and quemliclustat may kill more cancer cells than chemotherapy a
 lone.\nClinicalTrials.gov: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05688215

  tests brain concentration level and safety of defactinib or VS-6766 for t
 he treatment of patients with glioblastoma. Recently\, two new drugs that 
 seem to work together have been shown to have promising treatment effects 
 in tissue culture and animal models of glioblastoma. Each inhibits a diffe
 rent glioblastoma growth pathway and when used together may create a large
 r effect on tumor growth than either alone. Growth pathway describes a ser
 ies of chemical reactions in which a group of molecules in a cell work tog
 ether to control cell growth. It is known that glioblastoma tumor cells ca
 n grow because of lack of regulation. Both Pyk2 and the closely related ki
 nase (FAK) proteins help regulate tumor cell invasion\, unless they are pr
 oduced in large amounts (over expressed). Specifically\, Raf and FAK/Pyk2 
 regulation of cell division is activated quite a bit more in gliomas compa
 red to normal tissues. Recently developed inhibitors of Raf (VS-6766) and 
 FAK (defactinib) which belong to a class of medications called kinase inhi
 bitors\, are aimed to bring their activity to proper levels and may stop t
 umor growth.\nClinicalTrials.gov: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT0579

 ry: This study is researching a drug called dupilumab. The study is focuse
 d on patients who have uncontrolled asthma. Asthma is a condition where th
 e airways narrow and swell\, making it difficult to breathe. Uncontrolled 
 asthma means that patients are still having frequent symptoms while taking
  their current asthma medication. The aim of the study is to see which reg
 imen is more effective: taking dupilumab with an inhaled asthma medication
  or only taking a higher dose of the inhaled asthma medication. The type o
 f asthma medication that will be used is a combination inhaled corticoster
 oid and long-acting beta-agonist (referred to as an ICS/LABA). Some patien
 ts may also receive an additional asthma medication called a long-acting m
 uscarinic antagonist (referred to as a LAMA) if they are already receiving
  a LAMA. The study is also looking at: • What side effects may happen from
  taking dupilumab\nClinicalTrials.gov: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NC

 n Criteria...\nSummary: ABBV-RGX-314 (also known as RGX-314) is being deve
 loped as a novel one-time gene therapy for the treatment of neovascular (w
 et) age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD or nAMD). Wet AMD is charact
 erized by loss of vision due to new\, leaky blood vessel formation in the 
 retina. Wet AMD is a significant cause of vision loss in the United States
 \, Europe and Japan\, with up to 2 million people living with wet AMD in t
 hese geographies alone. Current anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (a
 nti-VEGF) therapies have significantly changed the landscape for treatment
  of wet AMD\, becoming the standard of care due to their ability to mainta
 in or prevent progression of vision loss in the majority of patients. Thes
 e therapies\, however\, require life-long intraocular injections\, typical
 ly repeated every 4 to 16 weeks in frequency\, to maintain efficacy. Due t
 o the burden of these treatments\, patients often experience a decline in 
 vision with reduced frequency of treatment over time.\nClinicalTrials.gov:

 ug called REGN4336. Some participants may receive additional investigation
 al drugs in combination with REGN4336. These additional drugs include REGN
 5678\, cemiplimab and sarilumab. The main purpose of this study is to dete
 rmine the safety\, tolerability (how the body reacts to the drug) and effe
 ctiveness of REGN4336 alone\, in combination with cemiplimab\, or in combi
 nation with REGN5678. REGN4336\, cemiplimab and REGN5678 are a type of tre
 atment for cancer called immunotherapy\,and are intended to activate T-cel
 ls to attack cancer cells. This study has 2 parts. The purpose of Part 1 i
 s to determine a safe dose of REGN4336 when given alone or when given in c
 ombination with cemiplimab or REGN5678. The purpose of Part 2 is to use th
 e REGN4336 dose(s) determined in Part 1 to further test how well REGN4336 
 works to shrink tumors either when given alone or in combination with cemi
 plimab or REGN5678. This study is looking at several other research questi

 alled REGN7508 and REGN9933. The study is focused on participants who have
  atrial fibrillation\, which means that the heart beats too fast and uneve
 nly. REGN7508 and REGN9933 are designed to help stop blood clots forming i
 n patients with atrial fibrillation. The aim of the study is to see how we
 ll REGN7508 and REGN9933 work in patients that get medicine for their atri
 al fibrillation. The bleeding effects of REGN7508 and REGN9933 will be com
 pared to another medicine (apixaban)\, which is available on the market to
  treat and prevent formation of blood clots. The study is looking at sever
 al other research questions\, including: What side effects may happen from
  taking REGN7508 or REGN9933 How well do the study drugs reduce the risk o
 f having a stroke How much of REGN7508 or REGN9933 is in the blood at diff
 erent times Whether the body makes antibodies against REGN7508 or REGN9933
  (which could make the drugs less effective or could lead to side effects)

 his study is researching an experimental drug called REGN7508 (called "stu
 dy drug"). The study is focused on adults undergoing elective\, unilateral
  (one side) total knee replacement surgery. The aim of the study is to see
  how effective the study drug is at preventing venous thromboembolism (VTE
 ) and other related diseases after total knee replacement surgery. The stu
 dy is looking at several other research questions\, including: What side e
 ffects may happen from taking the study drug How much study drug is in the
  blood at different times * Whether the body makes antibodies against the 
 study drug (which could make the study drug less effective or could lead t
 o side effects)\nClinicalTrials.gov: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT0
