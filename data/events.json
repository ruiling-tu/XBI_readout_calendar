The study is focused on patients with a type of skin cancer known as melanoma. The aims of the study are to see how effective the combination of fianlimab and cemiplimab are in treating the melanoma skin cancer, in comparison with a medication, pembrolizumab, approved for the treatment of melanoma skin cancer in adults, and to observe any similarities, or differences, in how the study drugs work in adolescent participants compared with adult participants. The study is looking at several other research questions, including: What side effects may happen from receiving the study drugs How much study drug is in the blood at different times Whether the body makes antibodies against the study drugs (which could make the drugs less effective or could lead to side effects). Antibodies are proteins that are naturally found in the blood stream that fight infections.

Hematopoietic...\nSummary: Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) is a group of disorders that gradually affect the ability of a person's bone marrow (semi-liquid tissue present in many bones like backbones) to produce normal blood cells. Some people with MDS have a risk of the disease progressing to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and a risk of death from the disease itself. Symptoms of MDS include fatigue, shortness of breath, unusual paleness due to anemia (low red blood cell count), easy or unusual bruising, and red spots just beneath the skin caused by bleeding. The purpose of this study is to see how safe and effective venetoclax and azacitidine (AZA) combination are when compared to AZA and a placebo (contains no medicine), in participants with newly diagnosed higher-risk MDS. Venetoclax is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of MDS. The study consists of two treatment arms - In one arm, participants will receive venetoclax and AZA. In another arm, participants will receive AZA and placebo. Adult participants with newly diagnosed higher-risk MDS will be enrolled. Around 500 participants will be enrolled in approximately 220 sites worldwide. Participants in one arm will receive oral doses of venetoclax tablet and intravenous (infusion in the vein) or subcutaneous (given under the skin) AZA solution. Participants in another arm will receive oral doses of placebo tablet and intravenous or subcutaneous AZA solution. There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the course of the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood and bone marrow tests, checking for side effects, and completing questionnaires.\nClinicalTrials.gov: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04401748",

This study is to evaluate how safe the combination of azacitidine and venetoclax is and how effective the combination of azacitidine and venetoclax is in adult participants with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), in China. Adverse events and change in disease state will be assessed. The combination of azacitidine and venetoclax is being evaluated in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Participants will receive azacitidine with increasing doses of venetoclax. Adult participants with a diagnosis of AML will be enrolled. Around 40 participants will be enrolled in the study in approximately 30 sites in China. At cycle 1 during ramp-up period, participants will receive venetoclax oral tablets once daily in increasing doses until the study dose is achieved on day 3. Then ventoclax oral tablets will continue once daily thereafter. Azacitidine will be given by subcutaneous injection (SC) for 7 days beginning on Day 1 of each 28-day cycle. There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic.

VYD2311 is a monoclonal antibody that attaches to the virus that causes COVID-19 and helps block it from entering your cells. It is being tested in adults and adolescents at least 12 years old. Participants in this study will be given a \"study drug\" that will be either VYD2311 or placebo. The study drug will be given as a shot into the muscle in the participant's upper thigh or upper arm once a month with a total of 3 shots during the study. This study will help researchers see how well VYD2311 works to prevent COVID-19 during the 90 days after the first shot. The study will also look at the safety and tolerability of VYD2311, how the study drug is processed by the body (pharmacokinetics), how the immune system reacts to the study drug (immunogenicity), and how well VYD2311 can block the virus from infecting cells (neutralization). To do these tests, your blood will be drawn at certain times during the study.\nClinicalTrials.gov: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07298434",

Approximately 24 participants will be enrolled in Group 1 and randomized to Cohort 1a or Cohort 1b. Those assigned to Cohort 1a will receive a low dose prime therapeutic vaccination of vector AdC7 on Day 1, followed by a booster vaccination on Day 91 using vector AdC6. Those assigned to Cohort 1b will receive a low dose prime therapeutic vaccination of vector AdC6 on Day 1, and will not receive a booster vaccination. Group 2 will then enroll approximately 24 participants randomized to Cohort 2a or Cohort 2b. Those assigned to Cohort 2a will receive a high dose prime therapeutic vaccination of vector AdC7 on Day 1, followed by a booster vaccination on Day 91 using vector AdC6. Those assigned to Cohort 2b will receive a high dose prime therapeutic vaccination of vector AdC6 on Day 1, and will not receive a booster vaccination. Group 3 will enroll approximately 8 participants randomized into Cohort 3a or Cohort 3b. Cohort 3a will receive the high dose prime VRON-0200 vaccination of vector AdC7 on Day 1, followed by doses of VIR-2218 plus VIR-3434 on Days 28, 56, 84, 112, 140 and 168, and then a booster using a high dose VRON-0200 vaccination of vector AdC6 on Day 196. Cohort 3b will receive the same high dose prime VRON-0200 vaccination of vector AdC7 followed by 6 doses of VIR-2218 plus VIR-3434 at the same timepoints as Cohort 3a, but will not receive the booster dose on Day 196. VRON-0200 vaccine doses will be administered by intramuscular (IM) injection. VIR-2218 and VIR-3434 will be administered subcutaneously. All study participants will be followed for a total of 1 year post-prime vaccination.\nClinicalTrials.gov: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06070051",

The study is being conducted in patients who have resectable stage II to IIIB (N2) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that can be treated with surgery. The aim of the study is to see how effective the combination of fianlimab, cemiplimab, and chemotherapy is in comparison with cemiplimab and chemotherapy as peri-operative therapy in participants with NSCLC. The study is looking at several other research questions, including: What side effects may happen from taking the study drugs How much of each study drug is in the blood at different times Whether the body makes antibodies against the study drugs (which could make the drugs less effective or could lead to side effects) How administering the study drugs might affect quality of life\nClinicalTrials.gov: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06161441",

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. IL-6 is expressed by prostate cancer and within the tumor microenvironment and shown to enhance prostate cancer and disease progression. Treatment with an anti-IL-6 antibody such as tocilizumab may inhibit cancer progression. Giving atezolizumab in combination with etrumadenant or tocilizumab may work better in treating prostate cancer.\nClinicalTrials.gov: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03821246",

The ThecaFlex DRx system is an investigational implantable medical device developed by Alcyone Therapeutics, Inc. It consists of a catheter, which is a flexible tube, connected to a port which is placed under the skin. Alcyone Therapeutics, Inc. has an ongoing study called PIERRE to test the ThecaFlex DRx system. Participants with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in the PIERRE study may be enrolled in the PIERRE-PK study. The main objective of the PIERRE-PK study is to learn how the body processes nusinersen when given by the ThecaFlex DRx system compared to a lumbar puncture. The main questions researchers want to answer are: What is the highest amount of nusinersen found in the blood after dosing? How much nusinersen is found in the blood over the first 24 hours after dosing? The PIERRE-PK study will be done as follows: Participants will be screened to check if they can join the study. The screening period will be up to 30 days for this study and may overlap with the PIERRE study. Participants will receive a dose of nusinersen by lumbar puncture. The ThecaFlex DRx system will be implanted after the lumbar puncture, as part of the PIERRE study. Participants will receive a dose of nusinersen by the ThecaFlex DRx system, as part of the PIERRE study. Researchers will take blood samples before and after each dose. The last blood sample will be taken 24 hours after the dose. The total study duration for each participant in the PIERRE-PK study will be approximately 5 months. This period will overlap with the participant's first 5 months in the PIERRE study.\nClinicalTrials.gov: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06555419",

This is an open-label study, meaning everyone in the study will receive dupilumab. Participants will have a screening visit where they will complete surveys and undergo an endoscopy (EGD). Blood and biopsies (small tissue samples) will also be collected. If eligible and enrolled into the study, participants will receive weekly subcutaneous (under the skin) injections of dupilumab for 52 weeks (one year). The first dose of dupilumab will be administered in the clinic at the enrollment visit (day 0) and participants (or their caregivers) will receive training on how to self-administer the remaining doses. Participants will return for study visits every at weeks 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 44, and 52. During these visits, vital signs (temperature, heart rate, etc.) will be collected and participants will complete surveys. During visits at week 12, 24, and 52, blood will be collected and an endoscopy with biopsy will be performed. At 64 weeks (12 weeks after the last dose of dupilumab), participants assigned female at birth (AFAB) may be asked to come to the clinic for a urine pregnancy test.\nClinicalTrials.gov: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06352073",

The study is focused on a type of skin cancer known as cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC). The aim of the study is to see if cemiplimab or cemiplimab in combination with fianlimab can eliminate or reduce the number of living cancer cells in tumor(s) if taken before surgery. The study is looking at several other research questions, including: Whether taking cemiplimab or cemiplimab in combination with fianlimab before surgery may make it possible to have a less extensive surgery or a different treatment plan after surgery Whether taking cemiplimab or cemiplimab in combination with fianlimab before surgery may make the cancer less likely to come back after surgery What side effects may happen from taking the cemiplimab or cemiplimab in combination with fianlimab How much of the cemiplimab or cemiplimab in combination with fianlimab is in the blood at different times * Whether the body makes antibodies against the study drug(s) (which could make the drug(s) less effective or could lead to side effects)\nClinicalTrials.gov: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06384820",

The purpose of this study is to see if the study medication dupilumab helps prevent those with mild to moderate asthma from having increased asthma symptoms, after being exposed to an experimental rhinovirus inoculation. This is a study about dupilumab which is a drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of moderate to severe asthma. Dupilumab is a medication that blocks pathways that cause asthmatic inflammation in the lungs, leading to symptoms and worsening lung function. During this study, subjects will be given either dupilumab or placebo and will subsequently be exposed to the the \"common\" cold virus (rhinovirus). The virus that the investigators are using has been safely used before in many studies like this involving thousands of volunteers, and the safe use of the virus in this research study has been reviewed by the FDA. The investigators will track asthma symptoms during the study with lung function tests, questionnaires, specimen collection, biomarkers, and physical exams. For data analysis the investigators will assess the samples collected to determine changes in the treatment groups. The investigators will also asses the symptom scores and deviations from baseline measures for lung function.\nClinicalTrials.gov: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04380038",

DR is a chronic and progressive complication of diabetes mellitus. It is a sight-threatening disease characterized in the early stages by neuronal and vascular dysfunction in the retina, and later by neovascularization that leads to further deterioration of functional vision. Despite the availability of current treatments, diabetic retinopathy remains the leading cause of vision loss in working-age adults, those between the ages of 20 and 74. Existing treatment with anti-VEGF agents, although shown to be effective, are limited by short therapeutic half-lives, which then require frequent intravitreal injections over the patient's lifetime, resulting in increased risk of associated adverse events and significant treatment burden. Due to the burden of treatment, patients often do not closely adhere to treatment regimens and experience sub-optimal outcomes and a decline in vision.\nClinicalTrials.gov: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04567550",

Patients may have improved DME with anti-VEGF therapy and ranibizumab has been found to reduce central macular thickness (CMT) with anti-VEGF therapy following vitrectomy. Those patients still require intravitreal injections but the pharmacokinetics of a vitrectomized eye are different than those eyes that have not undergone vitrectomy. The clearance of protein molecules is quicker in vitrectomized eyes so these patients may be more refractory to standard of care anti-VEGF therapy. In rabbit models, the half-life of both bevacizumab and ranibizumab were reduced by a factor 1.8 and 1.3, respectively, after pars plana vitrectomy. In a study examining intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide in human eyes, the half-life was found to be 18.6 days in non-vitrectomized eyes and 3.2 days in vitrectomized eyes, but there was considerable intrasubject variation. Patients with various disease states, including neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) have been managed with monthly anti-VEGF therapy successfully after vitrectomy surgery. Another study performed by the DRCR net showed that patients with DME treated with anti-VEGF are not affected in the long term if they had had a previous vitrectomy. High dose aflibercept may improve anatomic and visual outcomes in this patient population. Also, high dose aflibercept may allow for longer treatment intervals in these vitrectomized eyes.\nClinicalTrials.gov: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06662994",

The study is focused on patients with certain solid tumors that are in an advanced stage. The aim of the study is to see how safe and tolerable marlotamig is by itself and in combination with cemiplimab (with or without chemotherapy), and to find out what is the best dose of marlotamig to be given to patients with advanced solid tumors when combined with cemiplimab (with or without chemotherapy). Another aim of the study is to see how effective marlotamig by itself, or in combination with cemiplimab (with or without chemotherapy), is at treating cancer patients. The study is also looking at: Side effects that may be experienced by people taking marlotamig by itself and in combination with cemiplimab with or without chemotherapy How marlotamig works in the body by itself and in combination with cemiplimab with or without chemotherapy How much marlotamig is present in the blood when given by itself and in combination with cemiplimab with or without chemotherapy To see if marlotamig by itself and in combination with cemiplimab with or without chemotherapy works to treat cancer by controlling the proliferation of tumor cells to shrink the tumor * Whether the body makes antibodies against the study drugs (marlotamig and cemiplimab) (which could make the drug less effective or could lead to side effects)\nClinicalTrials.gov: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04626635",

The typical treatment for nAMD is frequent injections of anti-VEGF therapy. Researchers are testing ABBV-RGX-314 to see if it has similar effects as the current approved standard of care, such as Lucentis\u00ae or Eylea\u00ae injections. The duration of this study will be up to 52 weeks or for ranibizumab control participants who cross over to ABBV-RGX-314 after week 52, up to 80 weeks post-randomization. The primary outcome measure for this investigational study is to evaluate the mean change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) for ABBV-RGX-314 compared with ranibizumab monthly at the Week 40 visit.\nClinicalTrials.gov: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04514653",

The drug works by controlling allergic inflammation of the esophagus. The esophagus is a food pipe that transfers food from the mouth into the stomach. Participants with EoE have dysfunction of the muscle of the esophagus (impaired peristalsis) that is not favorable for the transport function. Main question this study aims to answer is: Whether Dupilumab helps improve muscle activity of the esophagus in participants with EOE? Participants will: Take Dupilumab every week for 12 weeks. Visit the clinic before and after starting the medication. Keep a diary of symptoms.\nClinicalTrials.gov: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06665971",

Sixteen tape strips from lesional skin will be performed before treatment with topical roflumilast and after 4 months of treatment for gene expression profiling.\nSecondary Endpoints:\n- Measure the overall response rate of topical roflumilast when applied to the skin of HS patients. \u2014 Baseline, 4 months \u2014 The efficacy assessment will be based on overall response rate (ORR) of topical roflumilast in patients with HS at 4 months.\n\nThe ORR will be measured using the change in total abscess and inflammatory nodule count (AN count) at week 16 vs number of active lesions at baseline. Change from baseline will be calculated as the week 16 value minus the baseline value.\n- Measure the change in quality of life for HS patients applying topical roflumilast to their skin \u2014 Baseline, 1 month, 4 months \u2014 The investigators will assess the patients' quality of life using Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score ranging from (0-30) where 0 has no effect on quality of life and 30 has an extremely large effect on quality of life. DLQI will be measured at months 0, 1 and 4 months.\n\nThe minimal clinically important difference on the DLQI score is a change of 4.\n- Measure the change in numerical pain score for HS patients applying topical roflumilast to their skin \u2014 Baseline, 1 month, 4 months \u2014 The investigators will assess the skin pain response using Numerical Rating Scale (NRS30). NRS an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable). NRS will be measured at months 0, 1 and 4 months.\n\nThe minimal clinically meaningful important difference on the NRS score is \u226530% reduction and \u22652-point reduction in skin pain from baseline.\nEligibility Criteria (excerpt): Inclusion Criteria: Must understand the risks and the benefits/purpose of the study and provide signed and dated informed consent.

As psoriasis and Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) share multiple inflammatory pathways, the investigators hypothesize that the use of topical roflumilast 0.3% foam is a safe and efficacious option as a monotherapy for patients with mild disease and as add-on therapy for maintenance and flares in patients with moderate to severe disease. The study will include correlative analysis to study gene expression profiling before and after therapy.\nClinicalTrials.gov: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07077902",

However, there is currently no adequate method to determine which patients should receive these adjuvant therapies. Identifying those with a good prognosis without adjuvant therapy could reduce the risk of adverse events, lessen the burden of clinic visits, and reduce healthcare costs. Among various approaches, ctDNA-based MRD (minimal residual disease) analysis is highly anticipated and has already been introduced into clinical practice for hematologic malignancies. However, solid tumors' development as a companion diagnostic has been limited, and regulatory approval is mainly being considered based on performance evaluation data. In this study, we will conduct a performance evaluation of MRD analysis using Signatera\u2122 in patients with stage I-III NSCLC while also collecting other prognostic factors based on clinicopathological information and survival data.\nClinicalTrials.gov: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06854939",

Reason for discontinuation will be reported if applicable.\n- Participant-caregiver assessment: Change from baseline in the Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index score \u2014 From baseline up to 24 months \u2014 The Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (cDLQI) it is a 10-item questionnaire that assesses six different aspects that may affect quality of life, including symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school performance, personal relationships, and treatment. Each of the 10 questions is scored from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much) and the overall cDLQI is calculated by summing the score of each question, resulting in a total score between 0-30. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired.\n- Participant-caregiver assessment: Change from baseline in the Infant's Dermatology Life Quality Index score \u2014 From baseline up to 24 months \u2014 The Infant Dermatology Quality of Life Index (iDLQI) contains 10 questions and a response scale divided into four boxes. Each box gives a point between 0 and 3. The lower number is understood as the most positive for the participant.\n\nThe index is filled out by a parent to a participating child between the ages of 0 to 5 years.\n\nPoints from each question are added together and the end-sum represents the score. The sum score can be between 0 and 30. The higher the score the worse the assumed quality of life.\n- Participant-caregiver assessment: Change from baseline in the Dermatitis Family Impact (DFI) questionnaire \u2014 From baseline up to 24 months \u2014 The DFI is a 10-item disease specific questionnaire assessing the impact of having a child with AD on family Quality of Life (QoL). The DFI questions are scored ranging from 0 to 3, and the total DFI score ranges from 0 to 30. The time frame of reference is the past week, and a higher DFI score indicates greater impairment in family QoL as affected by AD.\n- Participant-caregiver assessment: Change from baseline in the patient's Worst Itch Numerical Rating Scale (WI-NRS) \u2014 From baseline up to 24 months \u2014 WI-NRS is a validated measure of itch severity. Patients will be asked daily to rate the intensity of their worst pruritus (itch) over the past 24 hours, using a 11-point scale ranging from 0 (no itch) to 10 (worst imaginable itch). Higher scores indicate more severity.\n- Caregiver assessment: Change from baseline in the patient's Worst Itch Scale Numerical Rating Scale (WSI-NRS) \u2014 From baseline up to 24 months \u2014 The WSI-NRS is a single-item caregiver-reported. The caregivers describe their child \"scratch\" or \"itch\" in the AD-affected area by using numeric response options (0: no scratching/itching to 10: worst scratching/itching). Higher scores indicate more severity.\n- Physician assessment: Change from baseline in the eczema severity using the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) \u2014 From baseline up to 24 months \u2014 The EASI is calculated by summing 4 separate scores of the (1) head/neck, (2) upper extremities, (3) trunk, and (4) lower extremities. For each of the 4 anatomical regions, the score formula is SxAxM \\[\"S\" is the congregate score from the severity of 4 signs: erythema, oedema/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification graded on a discrete scale from 0 to 3, where 0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe, giving S a maximum of 12. \"A\" represents the area to which AD affects the body, yielding a maximum of 6 points: 0 = 0%, 1 = 1-9%, 2 = 10-29%, 3 = 30-49%, 4 = 50-69%, 5 = 70-89%, and 6 = 90-100%. \"M\" is a multiplier, which is 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4, respectively, for the region affected in those \u22658 years and 0.2, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.3, respectively, for those \\<8 years. The final EASI score is calculated based on the sum of the scores from the 4 anatomical regions. A higher score means higher AD severity. Scores range from 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease severity).\n- Physician assessment: Percent change from beseline in the Body Surface Area (BSA) (%) affected by AD \u2014 From baseline up to 24 months \u2014 BSA affected by AD disease will be assessed for each major section of the body (head, neck, anterior trunk, back, upper limbs, lower limbs, and genitals). It will be reported as a percentage of all major body sections combined.\n- Physician assessment: Change in Proportion of patients with Validated Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) \u2014 From baseline up to 24 months \u2014 The IGA is an Investigator-completed assessment scale used to determine severity of AD and clinical response to treatment. It is based on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe).\n- Physician assessment: Change from baseline in Biomarkers \u2014 From baseline up to 24 months \u2014 Biomarker analysis will be performed, if available, in routine clinical practice and at routine visits\n- Number of Adverse Events (AE) / Serious Adverse Events (SAE) / Adverse Event of Special Interest (AESI) \u2014 From date of signed ICF, up to 24 months \u2014 The number of events and the percentage of patients who had at least one event will be described.\n- Health Care Resource Utilization (HCRU) Questionnaire \u2014 From baseline up to 24 months \u2014 Health care resource utilization may include hospitalizations (including length of stay), outpatient visits, urgent care or emergency room visits.\nEligibility Criteria (excerpt): Inclusion Criteria: Male or female aged 6 months to 11 years old at baseline.

Wet AMD is characterized by loss of vision due to new, leaky blood vessel formation in the retina. Wet AMD is a significant cause of vision loss in the United States, Europe and Japan, with up to 2 million people living with wet AMD in these geographies alone. Current anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapies have significantly changed the landscape for treatment of wet AMD, becoming the standard of care due to their ability to prevent progression of vision loss in the majority of patients. These therapies, however, require life-long intraocular injections, typically repeated every four to 12 weeks in frequency, to maintain efficacy. Due to the burden of treatment, patients often experience a decline in vision with reduced frequency of treatment over time. ABBV-RGX-314 is being developed as a potential one-time treatment for wet AMD.\nClinicalTrials.gov: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05407636",

The main questions it aims to answer are: Whether bitopertin increases pain-free sunlight exposure after 6 months of treatment in participants with EPP or XLP. How PPIX concentration levels change from before bitopertin treatment to after 6 months of treatment. Researchers will compare bitopertin to a placebo look-alike substance that contains no drug. Participants will complete daily questionnaires and attend study visits for assessments.\nClinicalTrials.gov: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06910358",

Wet AMD is characterized by loss of vision due to new, leaky blood vessel formation in the retina. Wet AMD is a significant cause of vision loss in the United States, Europe and Japan, with up to 2 million people living with wet AMD in these geographies alone. Current anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapies have significantly changed the landscape for treatment of wet AMD, becoming the standard of care due to their ability to prevent progression of vision loss in the majority of patients. These therapies, however, require life-long intraocular injections, typically repeated every four to 12 weeks in frequency, to maintain efficacy. Due to the burden of treatment, patients often experience a decline in vision with reduced frequency of treatment over time. ABBV-RGX-314 is being developed as a potential one-time treatment for wet AMD.\nClinicalTrials.gov: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05407636",

These types of immunotherapy study drugs are collectively known as immune checkpoint inhibitors. Immunotherapies are treatments that use the immune system to recognize and kill cancer cells. The study is focused on participants with a type of skin cancer known as melanoma. The objective of this study is to see if the combination of fianlimab and cemiplimab is an effective treatment compared to cemiplimab in participants with high-risk, resectable melanoma. Participants will receive treatment before surgery, undergo resection, and then will have the option to continue treatment after resection. The study is looking at several other research questions, including: What side effects may happen from receiving the study drug(s). How much study drug(s) is in the blood at different times. Whether the body makes antibodies against the study drug(s) (which could make the drug less effective or could lead to side effects). Antibodies are proteins that are naturally found in the blood stream that fight infections. How administering the study drugs might improve quality of life.\nClinicalTrials.gov: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06190951",

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as zimberelimab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Quemliclustat acts as a blocker for adenosine. Adenosine is a chemical produced in the body that can lead to a decrease in the immune system's response towards cancer. Quemliclustat has the potential to decrease the amount of adenosine, allowing the immune system to recognize and act against the cancer. Chemotherapy drugs, such as oxaliplatin, irinotecan, leucovorin, and fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving chemotherapy in combination with zimberelimab and quemliclustat may kill more cancer cells than chemotherapy alone.\nClinicalTrials.gov: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05688215",

Recently, two new drugs that seem to work together have been shown to have promising treatment effects in tissue culture and animal models of glioblastoma. Each inhibits a different glioblastoma growth pathway and when used together may create a larger effect on tumor growth than either alone. Growth pathway describes a series of chemical reactions in which a group of molecules in a cell work together to control cell growth. It is known that glioblastoma tumor cells can grow because of lack of regulation. Both Pyk2 and the closely related kinase (FAK) proteins help regulate tumor cell invasion, unless they are produced in large amounts (over expressed). Specifically, Raf and FAK/Pyk2 regulation of cell division is activated quite a bit more in gliomas compared to normal tissues. Recently developed inhibitors of Raf (VS-6766) and FAK (defactinib) which belong to a class of medications called kinase inhibitors, are aimed to bring their activity to proper levels and may stop tumor growth.\nClinicalTrials.gov: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05798507",

However, limited information is known about AD in Asian and African American populations because most molecular studies have focused on Caucasians with AD. This trial will determine differences in inflammatory responses to dupilumab between Caucasian, Asian, and African American patients with AD. The central hypothesis of this study is that ethnic differences in both immune and stromal cells contribute to variability in AD presentation and response to anti-interleukin-4 receptor (IL-4R) inhibition with dupilumab.\nClinicalTrials.gov: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05268107",

Asthma is a condition where the airways narrow and swell, making it difficult to breathe. Uncontrolled asthma means that patients are still having frequent symptoms while taking their current asthma medication. The aim of the study is to see which regimen is more effective: taking dupilumab with an inhaled asthma medication or only taking a higher dose of the inhaled asthma medication. The type of asthma medication that will be used is a combination inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta-agonist (referred to as an ICS/LABA). Some patients may also receive an additional asthma medication called a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (referred to as a LAMA) if they are already receiving a LAMA.

Wet AMD is characterized by loss of vision due to new, leaky blood vessel formation in the retina. Wet AMD is a significant cause of vision loss in the United States, Europe and Japan, with up to 2 million people living with wet AMD in these geographies alone. Current anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapies have significantly changed the landscape for treatment of wet AMD, becoming the standard of care due to their ability to maintain or prevent progression of vision loss in the majority of patients. These therapies, however, require life-long intraocular injections, typically repeated every 4 to 16 weeks in frequency, to maintain efficacy. Due to the burden of these treatments, patients often experience a decline in vision with reduced frequency of treatment over time.\nClinicalTrials.gov: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04704921",

The study is focused on patients with a type of cancer that can be potentially imaged using 89Zr-DFO-REGN5054 and show special tumor features that may be important to the way the immune system fights cancer. The aim of the study is to study the safety and tolerability (how the body reacts to the drug) of the imaging agent 89Zr-DFO REGN5054. The study is looking at several other research questions, including: What side effects may happen from taking the study drugs How much study drug is in the blood at different times * Whether the body makes antibodies against the study drugs (which could make the study drugs less effective or could lead to side effects)\nClinicalTrials.gov: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05259709",

Some participants may receive additional investigational drugs in combination with REGN4336. These additional drugs include REGN5678, cemiplimab and sarilumab. The main purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability (how the body reacts to the drug) and effectiveness of REGN4336 alone, in combination with cemiplimab, or in combination with REGN5678. REGN4336, cemiplimab and REGN5678 are a type of treatment for cancer called immunotherapy,and are intended to activate T-cells to attack cancer cells. This study has 2 parts. The purpose of Part 1 is to determine a safe dose of REGN4336 when given alone or when given in combination with cemiplimab or REGN5678. The purpose of Part 2 is to use the REGN4336 dose(s) determined in Part 1 to further test how well REGN4336 works to shrink tumors either when given alone or in combination with cemiplimab or REGN5678. This study is looking at several other research questions, including: What side effects may happen from taking REGN4336 alone, in combination with cemiplimab, or in combination with REGN5678? How much REGN4336 is in the blood at different times when it is given alone, in combination with cemiplimab, or in combination with REGN5678? * Does the body make antibodies against the study drugs (REGN4336, cemiplimab, or REGN5678)?\nClinicalTrials.gov: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05125016",

The study is focused on people with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). The aim of the study is to see how safe and effective the pozelimab + cemdisiran combination is for people with PNH and how the combination compares with 2 existing treatments: ravulizumab and eculizumab. The pozelimab + cemdisiran combination may be referred to as \"study drugs\". Ravulizumab and eculizumab may also be called the \"comparator drug\". The study is looking at several research questions, including: How effective is the pozelimab + cemdisiran combination compared to ravulizumab? How effective is pozelimab + cemdisiran combination compared to eculizumab? What side effects may happen from taking the study drugs? How much study drugs are in the blood at different times? * Whether the body makes antibodies against the study drugs (which could make the study drugs less effective or could lead to side effects)\nClinicalTrials.gov: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05133531",
