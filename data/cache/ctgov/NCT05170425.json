Determine whether Prospera can detect AR (acute rejection) and/or infection earlier than standard clinical indicators used concurrently during the study.\n2. Evaluate Prospera's ability to differentiate between rejection and infectious injuries for single and repeat episodes of bacterial, viral, mycobacterial and fungal infections.\n3. Evaluate changes in Prospera dd-cfDNA as an indicator for biopsy proven acute rejection (BPAR), graft failure, death, development of donor-specific antibodies (DSA), chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), infection episodes and response to treatment for rejection.\n4. Evaluate changes in Prospera dd-cfDNA in assessments involving standard management for acute rejection and infection events."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Lung Transplant Rejection"],"keywords":["Prospera","Lung Transplant","Rejection"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"3 Years","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":154,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cohort 1","description":"1\\) Cohort 1: Previously enrolled AND randomized in LAMBDA 001 Participants enrolled to Cohort 1 will be enrolled at least 12 and up to 18 months post-transplant.","interventionNames":["Device: Prospera"]},{"label":"Cohort 2","description":"2\\) Cohort 2: Not previously randomized in LAMBDA 001 Participants who were enrolled in LAMBDA 001 but who were not randomized in LAMBDA 001 may be enrolled to Cohort 2.","interventionNames":["Device: Prospera"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Prospera","description":"Prospera™ detects allograft rejection noninvasively and with high accuracy by measuring the fraction of donor derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) in the patient's blood, without the need for prior donor or recipient genotyping.\n\nProspera is a commercially available Laboratory Developed Test (LDT) certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA).
