In such cases the pre-treatment biopsy should be taken where feasible from the area of presumed higher-grade disease to confirm grade 2 or 3 disease to confirm eligibility\n  * Patients without confirmation of grade 2 or 3 disease will not be eligible for the study unless in the case where radiology features are consistent with high grade disease but a biopsy confirmation of this is not technically feasible. Such cases should be discussed with the principal investigator before enrollment onto the study\n* Have a documented IDH1 gene mutation (from a fresh tumor biopsy or from archived tumor tissue) confirmed by a CLIA approved laboratory.\n* Have an ECOG OS score of 0 to 2.\n* Have expected survival of \\>/= 4 months.\n* Have at least one measurable lesion as defined by RECIST 1.1, subjected who have received prior local therapy are eligible provided the measurable disease falls outside of the treatment field or within the field and has shown \\>/=20% growth in size since post-treatment assessment.\n* Have documented radiographic disease progression within the preceding 4 months before study entry (date ICF signed).\n\nHave recovered from toxicities associated with prior anti-cancer therapy to baseline unless stabilized under medical management (see washout time from different therapies in Exclusion Criteria section).\n\n* Have adequate bone marrow functions as evidenced by:\n\n  * Absolute neutrophil count \\>/=1,500/mm\\^3 or 100 x 10\\^9/L.\n  * Hemoglobin \\>/=8/dL.\n  * Platelets \\>/=100,000/mm\\^3 or 100 x 10\\^9/L.\n* Have adequate hepatic function as evidenced by:\n\n  * Serum total bilirubin \\</=2 x upper limit of normal (ULN), unless considered due to Gilbert's disease.\n  * Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \\</=5 x ULN.\n* Have adequate renal function as evidenced by:\n\n  * Serum creatinine \\<1.5 x ULN OR\n  * creatinine clearance \\>/= 50ml/min based on the cockcroft-gault glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimation:\n  * (140 Age) x (weight in kg) x (0.85 if female)/72 x serum creatinine\n* Be able to understand and willing to sign the informed consent form and to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans, procedures and laboratory tests, including serial peripheral blood sampling and urine sampling, during the study. A legally authorized representative may consent on behalf of a subject who is otherwise unable to provide informed consent if acceptable to and approved by the site's Institutional Review Board (IRB)\n* Be able to swallow oral medication.\n* Female subjects with reproductive potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test prior to the start of therapy, or a confirmation from an obstetrician in case of equivocal serum pregnancy results. Females of reproductive potential are defined as sexually mature women who have not undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal occlusion or who have not been naturally postmenopausal (i.e., who have not menstruated) for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., have not had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months). Women of reproductive potential, as well as fertile men and their partners who are female with reproductive potential, must agree to use 2 effective forms of contraception (including at least 1 barrier form) from the time of giving informed consent throughout the study and for 90 days (both females and males) following the last dose of study drug.
