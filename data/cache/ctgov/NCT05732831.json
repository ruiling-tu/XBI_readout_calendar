The first part of the study is an open-label, dose escalation and the second part is an open label dose expansion in specific MTAP-deleted tumor types. The study drug, TNG462, is a selective PRMT5 inhibitor administered orally. The study is planned to treat up to 225 participants.","detailedDescription":"This is a Phase 1/2 multi-center, open label study in solid tumor patients who have a confirmed homozygous MTAP deletion in their tumor. The Phase 1 portion is a dose escalation study of oral TNG462 administered as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with confirmed MTAP-deleted solid tumors. In Phase 2, 6 expansion arms defined by confirmed MTAP-deleted tumor types will enroll in parallel at the RP2D(s) of TNG462 and in combination. In both parts of the study participants who tolerate the drug may continue treatment until disease progression."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Locally Advanced Solid Tumor"],"keywords":["MTAP
