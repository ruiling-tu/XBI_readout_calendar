Subjects who complete dosing with rusfertide until the end-of-treatment visit of a Phase 2 rusfertide study and meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for this study, are eligible to participate in this open-label study and continue treatment with rusfertide.","detailedDescription":"This is an open-label study designed to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of rusfertide. This study aims to provide long-term rusfertide treatment to subjects who complete dosing until the end-of-treatment of a previous Phase 2 rusfertide study and are likely to continue benefiting from treatment with rusfertide based on their improved control of hematocrit levels \\<45% and reduced need for therapeutic phlebotomies. This study will provide long-term rusfertide treatment to these subjects and obtain data on safety and efficacy of long-term treatment with rusfertide."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Polycythemia Vera"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Open-label rusfertide","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":46,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Open-label rusfertide","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Open-label rusfertide","interventionNames":["Drug: Open-label rusfertide"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Open-label rusfertide","description":"subcutaneous rusfertide","armGroupLabels":["Open-label rusfertide"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Hematocrit","description":"Median hematocrit","timeFrame":"0-2 years"},{"measure":"Phlebotomies","description":"Number of phlebotomies","timeFrame":"0-2 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subject who has completed at least 12 months of dosing with rusfertide and successfully completed the end of treatment visit of a previous Phase 2 study of rusfertide.\n* Subject understands the study procedures, is willing and able to adhere to study requirements and agrees to participate in the study by giving written informed consent.\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subject who, in the opinion of the investigator, should not participate in the study.\n* Subject who discontinue early from a previous rusfertide study for reasons other than enrolling in this study.\n* Pregnant or lactating females.\n* Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) who do not agree to use medically acceptable contraception (\\<1% annual failure rate) during the study and for 30 days after the last dose of study drug.\n* Men with partners of childbearing potential who do not agree to use medically acceptable contraception (\\<1% annual failure rate) during the study and for 90 days after the last dose of study drug.\n* Men who do not agree to use a condom during the study and for 90 days after the last dose of study drug regardless of the partner's childbearing potential.\n* A female subject intends to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purposes of assisted reproduction during the study and for a period of 30 days after receiving the last dose of study drug.\n* A male subject intends to donate sperm for the purpose of reproduction during the study and for a minimum of 90 days after receiving the last dose of study drug.\n* Plan to use investigational treatment other than rusfertide during the course of the study or within 28 days after last rusfertide dose.\n* Subject with hypersensitivity to rusfertide or to any of the excipients.\n* In the investigator's opinion the subject has progressive disease that cannot be managed by adjusting concurrent cytoreductive therapy.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Pontchartrain Cancer Care","city":"Covington","state":"Louisiana","zip":"70433","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":30.47549,"lon":-90.10042}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2026-02-25"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D011087","term":"Polycythemia Vera"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D019046","term":"Bone Marrow Neoplasms"},{"id":"D019337","term":"Hematologic Neoplasms"},{"id":"D009371","term":"Neoplasms by Site"},{"id":"D009369","term":"Neoplasms"},{"id":"D001855","term":"Bone Marrow Diseases"},{"id":"D006402","term":"Hematologic Diseases"},{"id":"D006425","term":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases"},{"id":"D009196","term":"Myeloproliferative Disorders"}]}},"hasResults":false}
