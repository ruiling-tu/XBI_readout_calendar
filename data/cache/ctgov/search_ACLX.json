Anitocabtagene-autoleucel is a BCMA-directed CAR-T cell therapy.","detailedDescription":"This is a Phase II open-label study of anitocabtagene-autoleucel \\* in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM). The study will have the following sequential phases: screening, enrollment, pre-treatment with lymphodepleting chemotherapy, treatment with anitocabtagene-autoleucel , and follow-up. If necessary, bridging therapy is allowed to control growth of MM disease while anitocabtagene-autoleucel is being manufactured.\n\nFollowing a single infusion of anitocabtagene-autoleucel both safety and efficacy data will be assessed. Efficacy will be assessed monthly for the first 6 months, then quarterly up to 2 years, or upon patient relapse. The primary analysis will be conducted approximately 13 months after the final patient is dosed. This will allow approximately 12 months follow up from the time of the last observed response on study.\n\nLong-term safety data will be collected under a separate long-term follow up study for up to 15 years per health authority guidelines.\n\n\\*Anitocabtagene-autoleucel drug product consists of autologous T cells that have been genetically modified ex vivo to express a D-domain Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR), followed by a cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) hinge and transmembrane region that is fused to the intracellular signaling domains for 4-1BB and CD3ξ, that specifically recognizes B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA). The active substance of anitocabtagene-autoleucel is CAR+ CD3+ T cells that have undergone ex vivo T-cell activation, gene transfer by replication-deficient lentiviral vector, and expansion."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Multiple Myeloma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":136,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"anitocabtagene-autoleucel","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Single dose of 115±10 x 10e-6 CAR+ anitocabtagene-autoleucel cells infused intravenously","interventionNames":["Biological: anitocabtagene-autoleucel"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"anitocabtagene-autoleucel","description":"Anitocabtagene-autoleucel-directed CAR T-cell therapy using a novel, synthetic binding domain, called a D-domain","armGroupLabels":["anitocabtagene-autoleucel"],"otherNames":["CART-ddBCMA"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Overall Response Rate (ORR)","description":"ORR Per International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria, as assessed by an independent review committee (IRC)","timeFrame":"24 Months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Stringent complete response (sCR) or complete response (CR) rate","description":"The proportion of participants in whom best response of sCR or CR,as assessed by an independent review committee (IRC) per by IMWG criteria","timeFrame":"24 Months"},{"measure":"Overall Response Rate (ORR) of participants limited to three lines of prior treatment","description":"ORR per IMWG criteria, as assessed by an independent review committee (IRC), of participants limited to three lines of prior treatment","timeFrame":"24 Months"},{"measure":"Duration of Response (DoR)","description":"DoR is defined as the time from the date of first documentation of response of PR or better per IMWG criteria after anitocabtagene-autoleucel infusion to the earlier of first documentation of disease progression per IMWG criteria or death","timeFrame":"24 Months"},{"measure":"Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) Rate and Partial Response (PR) Rate","description":"The proportion of participants with best response of VGPR and PR, respectively, by IMWG criteria","timeFrame":"24 Months"},{"measure":"Time to Initial Response","description":"Time to initial response is defined as the measurement of time from the date of infusion of anitocabtagene-autoleucel to the date upon which the first IMWG response (i.e., PR or better) occurs","timeFrame":"24 months"},{"measure":"Progression Free Survival (PFS)","description":"PFS is defined as the measurement of time from the date of infusion of anitocabtagene-autoleucel to the date upon which the IMWG criteria for progressive disease or death occurs","timeFrame":"24 Months"},{"measure":"Overall Survival (OS)","description":"OS is defined as the measurement of time (e.g., days or months) from the date of infusion of anitocabtagene-autoleucel to the date upon which death from any cause occurs","timeFrame":"24 Months"},{"measure":"Safety Profile of anitocabtagene-autoleucel as assessed by incidence and severity of adverse events","description":"Summarization of adverse event (AE) terms, frequency, and severity using CTCAE version 5.0, the adverse events of special interest (AESIs), the serious adverse events (SAEs)","timeFrame":"24 Months"},{"measure":"Pharmacokinetics of anitocabtagene-autoleucel","description":"Pharmacokinetics of anitocabtagene-autoleucel is defined as the using vector copy number (VCN) on peripheral mononuclear cells at defined timepoints.
