The study is focused on people with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). The aim of the study is to see how safe and effective the pozelimab + cemdisiran combination is for people with PNH and how the combination compares with 2 existing treatments: ravulizumab and eculizumab.\n\nThe pozelimab + cemdisiran combination may be referred to as \"study drugs\". Ravulizumab and eculizumab may also be called the \"comparator drug\".\n\nThe study is looking at several research questions, including:\n\n* How effective is the pozelimab + cemdisiran combination compared to ravulizumab?\n* How effective is pozelimab + cemdisiran combination compared to eculizumab?\n* What side effects may happen from taking the study drugs?\n* How much study drugs are in the blood at different times?\n* Whether the body makes antibodies against the study drugs (which could make the study drugs less effective or could lead to side effects)"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria"],"keywords":["PNH"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":190,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cohort A","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Randomized 1:1","interventionNames":["Drug: Ravulizumab","Drug: Pozelimab","Drug: Cemdisiran"]},{"label":"Cohort B","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Randomized 1:1","interventionNames":["Drug: Pozelimab","Drug: Cemdisiran","Drug: Eculizumab"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Ravulizumab","description":"Administered Intravenous (IV) per the protocol","armGroupLabels":["Cohort A"],"otherNames":["ALXN1210","Ultomiris"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Pozelimab","description":"Administered IV and subcutaneous (SC) per the protocol","armGroupLabels":["Cohort A","Cohort B"],"otherNames":["REGN3918"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Cemdisiran","description":"Administered SC per the protocol","armGroupLabels":["Cohort A","Cohort B"],"otherNames":["ALN-CC5"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Eculizumab","description":"Administered IV per the protocol","armGroupLabels":["Cohort B"],"otherNames":["Soliris"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Percent change in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)","description":"Cohort A","timeFrame":"From baseline to week 26"},{"measure":"Transfusion avoidance","description":"Cohort B Not requiring a red blood cell (RBC) transfusion per the protocol","timeFrame":"From post-baseline day 1 through week 26"},{"measure":"Adequate control of hemolysis","description":"Cohort B LDH ≤1.5 × ULN at each visit","timeFrame":"From week 8 through week 26, inclusive"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Maintenance of adequate control of hemolysis","description":"Cohort A and B LDH ≤1.5 × ULN","timeFrame":"From week 8 through week 26, inclusive"},{"measure":"Breakthrough hemolysis","description":"Cohort A and B LDH ≥2 × ULN per the protocol","timeFrame":"From post-baseline day 1 through week 26"},{"measure":"Adequate control of hemolysis","description":"Cohort A LDH ≤1.5 × ULN","timeFrame":"From week 8 through week 26, inclusive"},{"measure":"Hemoglobin stabilization","description":"Cohort A and B Patients who do not receive an RBC transfusion and have no decrease in hemoglobin level per the protocol","timeFrame":"From day 1 (post-baseline) through week 26"},{"measure":"Normalization of LDH","description":"Cohort A and B LDH ≤1.0 × ULN per the protocol","timeFrame":"Between week 8 through week 26, inclusive"},{"measure":"Transfusion avoidance","description":"Cohort A Not requiring an RBC transfusion as per protocol algorithm based on post-baseline hemoglobin values.","timeFrame":"Day 1 through week 26"},{"measure":"Change in fatigue as measured by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue Scale","description":"Cohort A and B FACIT-Fatigue Scale is a 13-item, self-reported PRO measure assessing an individual's level of fatigue during their usual daily activities over the past week.
