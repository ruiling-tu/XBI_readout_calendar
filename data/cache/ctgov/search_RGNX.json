DR is a chronic and progressive complication of diabetes mellitus. It is a sight-threatening disease characterized in the early stages by neuronal and vascular dysfunction in the retina, and later by neovascularization that leads to further deterioration of functional vision. Despite the availability of current treatments, diabetic retinopathy remains the leading cause of vision loss in working-age adults, those between the ages of 20 and 74. Existing treatment with anti-VEGF agents, although shown to be effective, are limited by short therapeutic half-lives, which then require frequent intravitreal injections over the patient's lifetime, resulting in increased risk of associated adverse events and significant treatment burden. Due to the burden of treatment, patients often do not closely adhere to treatment regimens and experience sub-optimal outcomes and a decline in vision.","detailedDescription":"This phase 2, randomized, dose-escalation study is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ABBV-RGX-314 gene therapy in subjects with DR with and without center-involved diabetic macular edema (CI-DME).\n\nPart 1: For subjects with DR without CI-DME, approximately 100 participants who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled into one of 5 cohorts. Participants will be randomized in Cohorts 1, 2, 4 and 5 to receive ABBV-RGX-314 or to be observed, and participants enrolled in Cohort 3 will receive ABBV-RGX-314. Cohort 1 will evaluate ABBV-RGX-314 Dose 1, Cohorts 2 and 3 will evaluate ABBV-RGX-314 Dose 2, and Cohorts 4 and 5 will evaluate ABBV-RGX-314 Dose 3. Following SCS ABBV-RGX-314 administration, participants in Cohorts 4 and 5 will receive a protocol-mandated post-procedure steroid regimen for 7 weeks. Participants who are randomized to be observed in Cohorts 1, 2, 4 and 5 will be offered ABBV-RGX-314 after completing the study.\n\nPart 2: For subjects with DR with CI-DME, approximately 30 participants who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled into one cohort (Cohort A). Participants will be randomized to receive ABBV-RGX-314 or Aflibercept Control. Cohort A will evaluate ABBV-RGX-314 Dose 4. Participants randomized to receive SCS ABBV-RGX-314 will receive a protocol-mandated course of steroid. Participants who are randomized to the Aflibercept Control arm will be offered ABBV-RGX-314 after completing the study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)","Center-Involved

Wet AMD is characterized by loss of vision due to new, leaky blood vessel formation in the retina. Wet AMD is a significant cause of vision loss in the United States, Europe and Japan, with up to 2 million people living with wet AMD in these geographies alone. Current anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapies have significantly changed the landscape for treatment of wet AMD, becoming the standard of care due to their ability to prevent progression of vision loss in the majority of patients. These therapies, however, require life-long intraocular injections, typically repeated every four to 12 weeks in frequency, to maintain efficacy. Due to the burden of treatment, patients often experience a decline in vision with reduced frequency of treatment over time. ABBV-RGX-314 is being developed as a potential one-time treatment for wet AMD.","detailedDescription":"This randomized, partially masked, controlled, Phase 3 clinical study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of ABBV-RGX-314 gene therapy in participants with nAMD. The study will evaluate 2 dose levels of RGX-314 gene therapy relative to an active comparator. The primary endpoint of this study is mean change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of ABBV-RGX-314 relative to aflibercept. Approximately 660 participants who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria, will be enrolled into one of 3 arms.\n\nA bilateral treatment substudy conducted at US sites is an open-label, partially randomized, parallel arm study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of subretinal ABBV-RGX-314 administered bilaterally in participants who have bilateral nAMD. Previously treated crossover participants from the control arm of the main study who crossed over and received ABBV-RGX-314 in the study eye will receive the same ABBV-RGX-314 dose in the contralateral eye (ie, same dose as in the study eye), and newcomers (participants who have not been randomized in an ABBV-RGX-314 study) and untreated crossover participants (ongoing control participants in the main study who have completed Week 54 but have not crossed over to receive ABBV-RGX-314 in the main study) will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive ABBV-RGX-314 Dose 1 or ABBV-RGX-314 Dose 2 in both eyes. Up to 15 participants who qualify for the substudy will be enrolled and followed for a minimum of 50 weeks."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["AMD","nAMD","Wet Age-related Macular Degeneration","wAMD","WetAMD","CNV"],"keywords":["Age-Related Macular Degeneration","Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration","Wet Macular Degeneration","Choroidal Neovascularization","Retinal Degeneration","Retinal Diseases","Eye Diseases","Ranibizumab","Aflibercept","Angiogenesis Inhibitors","Angiogenesis Modulating Agents","Growth Substances","Physiological Effects of Drugs","Growth Inhibitors","Antineoplastic Agents","Gene Therapy","Anti-vascular endothelial grown factory therapy","Anti-VEGF therapy","Macular Degeneration"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"2 ABBV-RGX-314 treatment arms, 1 control arm (aflibercept)","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","maskingDescription":"ABBV-RGX-314 administration is performed as an outpatient surgical procedure in an operating room, while the active control, aflibercept, is administered via intravitreal injection in an office setting.

The typical treatment for nAMD is frequent injections of anti-VEGF therapy. Researchers are testing ABBV-RGX-314 to see if it has similar effects as the current approved standard of care, such as Lucentis® or Eylea® injections.\n\nThe duration of this study will be up to 52 weeks or for ranibizumab control participants who cross over to ABBV-RGX-314 after week 52, up to 80 weeks post-randomization.\n\nThe primary outcome measure for this investigational study is to evaluate the mean change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) for ABBV-RGX-314 compared with ranibizumab monthly at the Week 40 visit.","detailedDescription":"This phase 2, randomized, dose-escalation study is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ABBV-RGX-314 gene therapy in subjects with nAMD.\n\nABBV-RGX-314 will be injected into the SCS part of the eye.

Wet AMD is characterized by loss of vision due to new, leaky blood vessel formation in the retina. Wet AMD is a significant cause of vision loss in the United States, Europe and Japan, with up to 2 million people living with wet AMD in these geographies alone. Current anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapies have significantly changed the landscape for treatment of wet AMD, becoming the standard of care due to their ability to maintain or prevent progression of vision loss in the majority of patients. These therapies, however, require life-long intraocular injections, typically repeated every 4 to 16 weeks in frequency, to maintain efficacy. Due to the burden of these treatments, patients often experience a decline in vision with reduced frequency of treatment over time.","detailedDescription":"This randomized, partially masked, active-controlled, Phase 2b/3 clinical study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of ABBV-RGX-314 gene therapy in participants with nAMD. The study will evaluate 2 dose levels of ABBV-RGX-314 relative to an active comparator. The primary endpoint of this study is the mean change from baseline in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of ABBV-RGX-314 relative to ranibizumab at Week 54. Approximately 630 participants who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria, will be enrolled into one of 3 arms.\n\nA bilateral treatment substudy conducted at US sites is an open-label, partially randomized, parallel arm study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of subretinal ABBV-RGX-314 administered bilaterally in participants who have bilateral nAMD. Previously treated crossover participants from the control arm of the main study who crossed over and received ABBV-RGX-314 in the study eye will receive the same ABBV-RGX-314 dose in the contralateral eye (ie, same dose as in the study eye), and newcomers (participants who have not been randomized in an ABBV-RGX-314 study) and untreated crossover participants (ongoing control participants in the main study who have completed Week 54 but have not crossed over to receive ABBV-RGX-314 in the main study) will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive ABBV-RGX-314 Dose 1 or ABBV-RGX-314 Dose 2 in both eyes. Up to 15 participants who qualify for the substudy will be enrolled and followed for a minimum of 50 weeks."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["AMD","nAMD","Wet Age-related Macular Degeneration","wAMD","Wet AMD","CNV","Neovascular AMD","Neovascular Age-related Macular Degeneration","Choroidal Neovascularization"],"keywords":["Age-Related Macular Degeneration","Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration","Macular Degeneration","Wet Macular Degeneration","Choroidal Neovascularization","Retinal Degeneration","Retinal Diseases","Eye Diseases","Ranibizumab","Angiogenesis Inhibitors","Angiogenesis Modulating Agents","Growth Substances","Physiological Effects of Drugs","Growth Inhibitors","Antineoplastic Agents","Gene therapy","Anti-vascular endothelial grown factory therapy","Anti-VEGF therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"2 ABBV-RGX-314 treatment arms, 1 control arm (ranibizumab)","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","maskingDescription":"The administration of ABBV-RGX-314 requires an outpatient surgical procedure performed in an operating room, while the active control, ranibizumab, is administered via intravitreal injection in an office setting.
