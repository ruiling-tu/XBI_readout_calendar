In this study, investigators hypothesize that the combination of cabozantinib (a multi-kinase inhibitor) and atezolizumab will result in better therapeutic value.","detailedDescription":"For metastatic/advanced non-small cell (NSCLC) patients who do not have targetable mutations, the combination of chemotherapy with immunotherapy targeting the programmed death-1 and its ligand (PD-1/L1) is now a standard of care. In addition, recent studies also demonstrated that immunotherapy doublet using anti-PD-1 agent nivolumab and anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) agent ipilimumab could be another valid option. However, largely due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, the therapeutic response remains suboptimal in NSCLC patients with PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) lower than 1% (aka PD-L1 negative). For example, the objective response rate (ORR) in KEYNOTE-189 was 32.3% using pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy, and only 27.3% in Checkmate 227 study using nivolumab and ipilimumab, in the PD-L1 negative population. These observations necessitate the search for novel combinations to benefit our PD-L1 negative NSCLC patients.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that the combination of cabozantinib and atezolizumab is such an innovative strategy based on the following rationales: 1) cabozantinib is a multi-kinase inhibitor, and some of the targets, for example the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway is notorious to confer immune suppressive tumor microenvironment. In fact, our previous study has demonstrated that anti-VEGF synergizes anti-PD-1 in preclinical model. Consistent with this, cabozantinib has been shown to increase tumor infiltrative cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, reduce immune suppressive T regulatory cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), as well as activate anti-tumor innate immunity in multiple solid tumors; 2) at the animal level, cabozantinib was found synergistic with anti-PD-1 agents to elicit anti-tumor immune response; and 3) more importantly, at the human level, the combination of cabozantinib with atezolizumab was found safe in Cohort 7 of the phase 1b COSMIC-021 study and achieved 27% ORR in previously immunotherapy-treated NSCLC - suggesting a potentially higher efficacy if such combination is to be used in the 1st line setting.\n\nThe investigators therefore propose here the combination of cabozantinib and atezolizumab to be used as the 1st line treatment for advanced/metastatic NSCLC with negative PD-L1 expression."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Lung Cancer","NSCLC Stage IV","Metastatic NSCLC - Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","Advanced NSCLC"],"keywords":["Cancer immunotherapy","anti-angiogenesis","Investigator-initiated clinical trial"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cabozantinib and Atezolizumab","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Cabozantinib 40mg po daily + Atezolizumab 1200mg iv on day 1; 1 cycle = 21 days","interventionNames":["Drug: Cabozantinib","Drug: Atezolizumab"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Cabozantinib","description":"Oral once per day, Days 1 - 21 every 21 days","armGroupLabels":["Cabozantinib and Atezolizumab"],"otherNames":["Cabometyx"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Atezolizumab","description":"Intravenous (IV) once every 21 days","armGroupLabels":["Cabozantinib and Atezolizumab"],"otherNames":["Tecentriq"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Objective response rate (ORR)","description":"From baseline to End of Treatment (EOT) due to disease progression using RECIST criteria 1.1","timeFrame":"through study completion, an average of 1 year"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Duration of response (DOR)","description":"The response to the study drugs will be determined using RECIST criteria 1.1","timeFrame":"From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months"},{"measure":"Progression-free survival (PFS)","description":"The lack of progression will be dertermined using RECIST criteria 1.1","timeFrame":"From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months"},{"measure":"Overall survival (OS)","description":"Medical Record will be followed to watch survival status","timeFrame":"From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months"},{"measure":"Drug Safety","description":"Safety of drugs will be determined by documenting adverse events and the severity of adverse events will be documented using CTCAE Version 5.0","timeFrame":"From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n* Ability of participant OR Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) to understand this study, and participant or LAR willingness to sign a written informed consent\n* Males and females age ≥ 18 years\n* ECOG Performance Status 0 - 1\n* Pathologically confirmed advanced/metastatic NSCLC, with PD-L1\\<1% based on IHC using 22C3 antibody\n* At least one target lesion that can be assessed by RECIST 1.1\n* For candidates who are not qualified for upfront FDA-approved targeted therapy, must be systemic treatment naïve (local palliative RT more than 4 weeks prior is allowed)\n* For candidates who are qualified for upfront FDA-approved targeted therapy (e.g. having sensitizing mutations in EGFR, ALK and BRAF, etc.), treatment must have failed and received at least one line of ONLY FDA-approved targeted therapy\n* Availability of a representative tumor specimen for correlative research.
