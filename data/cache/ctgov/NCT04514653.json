The typical treatment for nAMD is frequent injections of anti-VEGF therapy. Researchers are testing ABBV-RGX-314 to see if it has similar effects as the current approved standard of care, such as Lucentis® or Eylea® injections.\n\nThe duration of this study will be up to 52 weeks or for ranibizumab control participants who cross over to ABBV-RGX-314 after week 52, up to 80 weeks post-randomization.\n\nThe primary outcome measure for this investigational study is to evaluate the mean change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) for ABBV-RGX-314 compared with ranibizumab monthly at the Week 40 visit.","detailedDescription":"This phase 2, randomized, dose-escalation study is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ABBV-RGX-314 gene therapy in subjects with nAMD.\n\nABBV-RGX-314 will be injected into the SCS part of the eye. Approximately 140 participants who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled into one of 7 cohorts. Participants will be randomized in Cohorts 1 and 2 to receive ABBV-RGX-314 or the intravitreal ranibizumab control. Participants enrolled in Cohorts 3 through 5 will receive ABBV-RGX-314. Participants enrolled in Cohort 6 will receive ABBV-RGX-314 and will be randomized to one of two different post-procedural steroid regimens. Participants randomized in Cohort 7 will receive ABBV-RGX-314 with a protocol mandated steroid regimen or the intravitreal ranibizumab control. Cohort 1 will evaluate ABBV-RGX-314 Dose 1, Cohorts 2 and 3 will evaluate ABBV-RGX-314 Dose 2, Cohorts 4, 5, and 6 will evaluate ABBV-RGX-314 Dose 3, and Cohort 7 will evaluate ABBV-RGX-314 Dose 4.\n\nThe duration of the study will be up to 52 weeks or for ranibizumab control participants who cross over to ABBV-RGX-314, up to 80 weeks post-randomization."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration (nAMD)"],"keywords":["AMD","wet AMD","wAMD","nAMD"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"The vision examiners and central reading center (CRC) graders will be masked, meaning they will be unaware of the participants' treatment assignment.
