Indications for monotherapy include platinum resistant epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), gastric/gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC), recurrent and either metastatic or unresectable melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer, cervical cancer, and microsatellite stable colorectal cancer (MSS CRC), and diffuse large cell B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) including patients with Richter transformation (DLBCL-RT). Indications for paclitaxel combo may include, but are not limited to, platinum-resistant EOC, gastric/GEJ cancer, HNSCC, NSCLC, TNBC, locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer, and cervical cancer at the Sponsor's discretion.\n\nPhase 1b will investigate the efficacy of NX-1607 as monotherapy or in combination with paclitaxel at the dose(s) selected in Phase 1a in select advanced malignancies for which standard therapy, including immunotherapy, with proven clinical benefit does not exist, is no longer effective, or is not appropriate. Indications include platinum-resistant EOC, including primary peritoneal and fallopian tube carcinoma, advanced gastric/GEJ cancer, HNSCC, recurrent and either metastatic or unresectable melanoma, advanced NSCLC, mCRPC, MSS CRC, mixed solid tumor cohort indications consisting of patients with MPM, TNBC, locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer, cervical cancer, and DLBCL including patients with DLBCL-RT.
