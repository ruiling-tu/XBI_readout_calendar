Refractory disease, defined as:\n\n      * Primary refractory T-ALL or T-LL, defined as failure to achieve CR after induction chemotherapy, per investigator assessment and based on biopsy-confirmed evidence of residual T-ALL or T-LL; OR\n      * Relapsed, refractory disease, defined as \\> 5% BM blasts or biopsy-confirmed evidence of residual TLL after 1 course of re-induction chemotherapy for patients who have relapsed after previously achieving a CR NOTE: Patients with mixed phenotype acute leukemia with T-cell dominant phenotype may be enrolled if the aforementioned criteria are met.\n4. Eligible for myeloablative conditioning for and allogeneic HSCT based on the investigator's assessment with an available donor identified by a FACT accredited transplant center.\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n\n1. CNS involvement meeting any of the following criteria: CNS-3 disease, progressive CNS involvement despite therapy, CNS parenchymal or cranial nerve lesions on imaging.\n2. Clinically active CNS dysfunction or known history of irreversible neurological toxicity related to prior antileukemic therapy.\n3. Receipt of prior CD7 targeted therapy.\n4. Systemic antileukemic therapy intended to induce or maintain remission within 14 days prior to completion of screening.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"50 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Stanford University School of Medicine","city":"Stanford","state":"California","zip":"94304","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":37.42411,"lon":-122.16608}},{"facility":"Colorado Blood Cancer Institute","city":"Denver","state":"Colorado","zip":"80218","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":39.73915,"lon":-104.9847}},{"facility":"University of Chicago","city":"Chicago","state":"Illinois","zip":"60637","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":41.85003,"lon":-87.65005}},{"facility":"The University of Kansas Cancer Center","city":"Fairway","state":"Kansas","zip":"66205","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":39.02223,"lon":-94.6319}},{"facility":"Dana Farber and Boston Children's Hospital","city":"Boston","state":"Massachusetts","zip":"02115","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":42.35843,"lon":-71.05977}},{"facility":"Cleveland Clinic- Taussig Cancer Center","city":"Cleveland","state":"Ohio","zip":"44106","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":41.4995,"lon":-81.69541}},{"facility":"OHSU Knight Cancer Institute Hematology Oncology","city":"Portland","state":"Oregon","zip":"97239","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":45.52345,"lon":-122.67621}},{"facility":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia","city":"Philadelphia","state":"Pennsylvania","zip":"19104","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":39.95238,"lon":-75.16362}},{"facility":"Sarah Cannon- TriStar Bone Marrow Transplant","city":"Nashville","state":"Tennessee","zip":"37203","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":36.16589,"lon":-86.78444}},{"facility":"Methodist Hospital - Texas Transplant Institute","city":"San Antonio","state":"Texas","zip":"78229","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":29.42412,"lon":-98.49363}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2026-02-25"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D054198","term":"Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma"},{"id":"D008223","term":"Lymphoma"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D007945","term":"Leukemia, Lymphoid"},{"id":"D007938","term":"Leukemia"},{"id":"D009370","term":"Neoplasms by Histologic Type"},{"id":"D009369","term":"Neoplasms"},{"id":"D006402","term":"Hematologic Diseases"},{"id":"D006425","term":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases"},{"id":"D008232","term":"Lymphoproliferative Disorders"},{"id":"D008206","term":"Lymphatic Diseases"},{"id":"D007160","term":"Immunoproliferative Disorders"},{"id":"D007154","term":"Immune System Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
