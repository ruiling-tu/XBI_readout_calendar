A particular focus is on molecular biomarker testing before the start of first-line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC. The data shall be used to assess the current state of care and to develop recommendations concerning topics that could be improved.\n\nPRO assessment will provide large-scale data on quality of life and anxiety/depression for real-life patients with NSCLC or SCLC in routine practice. In addition, two questionnaires (concerning individual quality of life and patient-caregiver communication) will be validated in German patients with metastatic NSCLC.\n\nFurthermore, CRISP will set up a decentralized clinically annotated tissue repository for future collaborative, investigational scientific biomarker testing."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)","Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Metastatic","Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Stage II","Non Small Cell Lung Cancer Stage III","Small-cell Lung Cancer","Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Stage I"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"3 Years","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"All patients will be asked to give consent for their tumor samples to be used for future investigational translational research.
