This study will be done in 3 parts, Part A, Part B, and Part C where different study drugs will be tested.\n\nPart A of the study is focused on healthy participants. Part B and C of the study is focused on participants with obesity.\n\nThe aim of Part A of the study is to see how safe and tolerable the study drug is in healthy participants. The aim of Part B and Part C of the study is to see how safe and effective the study drug is when combined with Wegovy.\n\nParts A, B, and C of the study are looking at several other research questions, including:\n\n* What side effects may happen from taking the study drug\n* How much study drug is in the blood at different times\n* Whether the body makes antibodies against the study drug (which could make the drug less effective or could lead to side effects)","detailedDescription":"Part A Healthy Volunteers\n\nPart B and Part C (starts after treatment for Part A has completed)
