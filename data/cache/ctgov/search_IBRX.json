The study consists of two cohorts: cohort 1 includes subjects with either newly diagnosed solid tumors who have not received prior therapy or subjects who have received prior first line treatment; and cohort 2 that includes subjects with relapsed/refractory (r/r) solid tumors who have progressive disease after receiving ≥ 2 prior therapies. The two cohorts will be conducted simultaneously.","detailedDescription":"Both cohorts will be enrolled simultaneously. Both cohorts have a part A (apheresis) and cohort 2 has a part B (M-CENK treatment \\[one bag has a 100 mL cell suspension containing 0.25 to 0.75 x 109 cells\\] and N-803 treatment).\n\nUp to 40 subjects may be enrolled in cohort 1. Subjects in cohort 1 will participate in apheresis collection of MNCs prior to receiving disease specific first-line therapy per primary oncologists' recommendations. Subjects who have completed apheresis in cohort 1 may subsequently enroll in cohort 2 part B if they have progressive disease after ≥ 2 prior therapies or if they have progressive disease within 12 months of receiving neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy.\n\nThey must also meet the inclusion criteria to participate in the treatment phase (cohort 2 part B). Additionally, all subjects will be re-evaluated to confirm that they still meet the specified eligibility criteria once the M-CENK cells are manufactured and prior to the first administration of M-CENK. The Sponsor will approve the subject's continued eligibility prior to receiving the manufactured M-CENK cells.\n\nUp to 21 subjects may be enrolled in cohort 2 part A so that up to 11 subjects receive at least 1 dose of M-CENK. A dose is a single administration of M-CENK cells or a single administration of N-803. Subjects in cohort 2 part A will undergo an apheresis collection of MNCs prior to receiving approximately 4 weeks of disease-specific therapy per oncologists' recommendations while the M-CENK cells are being manufactured for use in the treatment phase (cohort 2 part B). Subjects will be evaluated for eligibility in inclusion/exclusion criteria prior to enrollment into part B. Additionally, all subjects will be re-evaluated to confirm that they still meet the specified eligibility criteria once the M-CENK cells are manufactured and prior to the first administration of M-CENK. The Sponsor will approve the subject's continued eligibility prior to receiving the manufactured M-CENK cells.\n\nM-CENK cells, manufactured from the autologous apheresis product, may be administered up to 10 times weekly starting on study day 1 with a minimum of 7 days between each M-CENK dose depending on the availability of cells and that there is no contra-indication to administer cells. Subjects will receive up to 5 doses of N-803 SC every 2 weeks prior to every other dose of M-CENK (ie, odd number M-CENK doses).The treatment may be administered for up to 10 doses of M-CENK, if the subject tolerates treatment, the doses of M-CENK cells are available, and the Investigator believes there may be potential benefit to the subject.\n\nSafety endpoints include assessments of TEAEs, SAEs, and clinically significant changes in safety laboratory tests, and vital signs. Toxicities will be graded using CTCAE Version 5.0, or in the case of CRS, using a specified grading system. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.\n\nThe treatment of the initial 3 subjects in cohort 2 part B will be staggered with at least a 2-week interval between each subject. After the first 3 subjects in cohort 2 part B are treated, the treatment of existing subjects in cohort 2 part B will be paused after the 14-day toxicity assessment period for a safety evaluation by the Safety Review Committee (SRC). Based on the SRC safety evaluation, the treatment of the subsequent subjects can proceed if the safety evaluation from the initial 3 subjects in part B suggests that the therapy is safe. There will be another safety review after all subjects in cohort 2 have completed the 14-day toxicity assessment period."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Metastatic Solid Tumor"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cohort 1: Subjects newly diagnosed no prior therapy or prior first line treatment","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Cohort 1: Subjects with either newly diagnosed solid tumors who have not received prior therapy or subjects who have received prior first line treatment.

To be eligible for this trial, participants should be class 2B or better.\n* Physician assessment indicating the patient would be able to tolerate undergoing a brief procedure for placement of an intraperitoneal port for NK cell infusion.\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. (Providing consents in as many languages as possible is encouraged)\n* The effects of CIML NK cells and N-803 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because CIML NK cells and N-803 are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation.

Note: Each study site should use its institutional LLN/ULN to determine eligibility.\n* History of or evidence of muscle-invasive, locally advanced, metastatic and/or extravesical bladder cancer (inclusive of the prostatic urethra); or any other cancer within the past 5 years that is progressing or requires active treatment. Exceptions are adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer; adequately treated stage I or II cancer or stable prostate cancer from which the participant is currently in complete remission, and is under active surveillance or hormone control; or any other cancer that investigator feels is stable with permission of Medical Monitor.\n* Suspicion of active upper tract urothelial malignancy.\n* Currently receiving investigational or commercial anticancer agents or anticancer therapies other than BCG, N-803, and supportive care therapies for active disease.\n* Symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF), New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure, or other clinical signs of severe cardiac dysfunction.\n* Severe/unstable angina pectoris, or myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to study entry.\n* History or evidence of uncontrollable central nervous system \\[CNS\\] disease.\n* Active systemic infection requiring parenteral antibiotic therapy. All prior infections must have resolved following optimal therapy.\n* Concurrent febrile illness, active urinary tract infection, active tuberculosis, a history of hypotension or anaphylactic reactions.\n* Ongoing chronic systemic steroid therapy required (\\>10 mg oral prednisone daily or equivalent).\n* Women who are pregnant or nursing. Female participants of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test and must adhere to using a medically acceptable method of birth control prior to screening and agree to continue its use during the study and for 7 months after the last dose of study drug, or be surgically sterilized (eg, hysterectomy or tubal ligation). Women of childbearing potential are defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who is NOT permanently sterile or postmenopausal. Postmenopausal is defined as 12 consecutive months with no menses without an alternative medical cause. Males must agree to use barrier methods of birth control while on study and for 90 days post last dose of study drug.\n* Other illness or condition, including laboratory abnormalities, which in the opinion of the Investigator would exclude the participant from participating in this study. This includes, but is not limited to, serious medical conditions or psychiatric illness likely to interfere with participation in the study.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Jayson Garmizo","role":"CONTACT","phone":"310-912-2230","email":"jayson.garmizo@immunitybio.com"},{"name":"Christine Rose Phipps","role":"CONTACT","email":"Christine.Phipps@immunitybio.com"}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2026-02-25"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000093284","term":"Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Neoplasms"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D002277","term":"Carcinoma"},{"id":"D009375","term":"Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial"},{"id":"D009370","term":"Neoplasms by Histologic Type"},{"id":"D009369","term":"Neoplasms"},{"id":"D001749","term":"Urinary Bladder Neoplasms"},{"id":"D014571","term":"Urologic Neoplasms"},{"id":"D014565","term":"Urogenital Neoplasms"},{"id":"D009371","term":"Neoplasms by Site"},{"id":"D052776","term":"Female Urogenital Diseases"},{"id":"D005261","term":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications"},{"id":"D000091642","term":"Urogenital Diseases"},{"id":"D001745","term":"Urinary Bladder Diseases"},{"id":"D014570","term":"Urologic Diseases"},{"id":"D052801","term":"Male Urogenital Diseases"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"C582303","term":"ALT-803"},{"id":"D000093542","term":"Gemcitabine"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D006571","term":"Heterocyclic Compounds"},{"id":"D003841","term":"Deoxycytidine"},{"id":"D003562","term":"Cytidine"},{"id":"D011741","term":"Pyrimidine Nucleosides"},{"id":"D011743","term":"Pyrimidines"},{"id":"D006573","term":"Heterocyclic Compounds, 1-Ring"}]}},"hasResults":false}
