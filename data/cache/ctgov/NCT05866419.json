The 12-month data will be used to assess the primary endpoint support a Pre-Market Approval (PMA) application.","detailedDescription":"This is a multicenter, multi-national, prospective, non-randomized, single arm, group sequential design, pivotal clinical investigation (device exemption study) to assess the safety and performance of the ThecaFlex DRx™ System in subjects with SMA.\n\nThe subject population will include subjects aged ≥ 3 years with SMA who are considered candidates for intrathecal port and catheter implantation because they require chronic, bolus intrathecal administration of necessary therapy, and who meet all the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the clinical investigation.\n\nAfter a screening period of up to 200 days, all enrolled subjects will undergo implantation of the investigational device (ThecaFlex DRx™ System) and will be followed for 12 months after receiving the implant.\n\nIn agreement with the nusinersen dosing information, the treatment frequency will be adapted for non-naïve and naïve subjects:\n\nSubjects who are not naïve to nusinersen should have nusinersen maintenance doses administered via the implant every 4 months (i.e., 4, 8, and 12 months after their last nusinersen dose, before enrollment in the clinical investigation).\n\nSubjects who are naïve to nusinersen will have their first three loading doses administered via the implant at 14-day intervals. The fourth loading dose should be administered 30 days after the third dose. A maintenance dose should be administered once every 4 months thereafter within the 12 months post-implantation.\n\nA DMC and Clinical Events Committee (CEC), independent of each other and the Sponsor, will be used to perform ongoing consistent adjudication of events related to the safety throughout the entire duration of the clinical investigation and to periodically review data that relate to the safety of the study.\n\nThe clinical investigation will enroll 90 subjects. The clinical investigation incorporates a lead-in phase which consists of 10 subjects enrolled, implanted, and followed for 30-days. Enrollment for the lead-in phase is expected to take approximately 6 to 9 months, at which point the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review the data for safety and approve continuation of enrollment. The second phase of enrollment is expected to take approximately 12 to 15 months.\n\nIndividual subjects are anticipated to be enrolled in the clinical investigation for approximately 37 months. The total duration of this clinical investigation is estimated to be approximately 60 months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Spinal Muscular Atrophy","Spine Deformity","Scoliosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":90,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"ThecaFlex DRx Port and Catheter System","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects who meet all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion would be eligible to receive the ThecaFlex DRx Port and Catheter System.","interventionNames":["Device: ThecaFlex DRx System"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"ThecaFlex DRx System","description":"The ThecaFlex DRx™ System consists of an implantable intrathecal catheter, and an implantable subcutaneous port, designed specifically to meet the implantation, Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) aspiration, and intrathecal delivery and dosing needs of patients (aged ≥ 3 years) requiring repeated/on-going intermittent chronic bolus intrathecal treatment for life threatening, debilitating Central Nervous System (CNS) disorders who are precluded from Lumbar Puncture (LP) due to complex spine conditions, or who are resistant to LP for therapy administration or CSF aspiration.","armGroupLabels":["ThecaFlex DRx Port and Catheter System"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The proportion of subjects with successful Implantation of the ThecaFlex DRx™ Port and Catheter","description":"The primary outcome measures the proportion of subjects with successful implantation of the ThecaFlex DRx™ Port and Catheter System who are able to receive successful intrathecal therapy infusion(s).","timeFrame":"12 Months"},{"measure":"The proportion of subjects with successful Intrathecal Therapy Infusion(s) through 12 months","timeFrame":"12 Months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of subjects with reduced anesthesia and radiation exposure compared to repeat LP for nusinersen infusion in SMA subjects.","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Incidence of device-related adverse events (AEs)/complications through 12 months","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Incidence of procedural complications through 12 months","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Incidence of nusinersen-related AEs","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Mean duration of radiation exposure from implant through 12-month follow-up","timeFrame":"12 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
