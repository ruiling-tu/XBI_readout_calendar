This study is to evaluate how safe the combination of azacitidine and venetoclax is and how effective the combination of azacitidine and venetoclax is in adult participants with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), in China. Adverse events and change in disease state will be assessed.\n\nThe combination of azacitidine and venetoclax is being evaluated in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Participants will receive azacitidine with increasing doses of venetoclax. Adult participants with a diagnosis of AML will be enrolled. Around 40 participants will be enrolled in the study in approximately 30 sites in China.\n\nAt cycle 1 during ramp-up period, participants will receive venetoclax oral tablets once daily in increasing doses until the study dose is achieved on day 3. Then ventoclax oral tablets will continue once daily thereafter. Azacitidine will be given by subcutaneous injection (SC) for 7 days beginning on Day 1 of each 28-day cycle.\n\nThere may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests, and checking for side effects."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)"],"keywords":["Acute Myeloid Leukemia","AML","Venetoclax","Venclexta","Azacitidine","Treatment Naïve AML","Untreated AML"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":44,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Venetoclax in Combination with Azacitidine","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive oral tablet venetoclax dose ramp-up only in Cycle 1 Days 1-3 until target dose is reached.
