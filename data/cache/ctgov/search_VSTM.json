This study is for individuals who have advanced colorectal cancer and their cancer has progressed while getting previous treatment or individuals who cannot take/tolerate previous treatments. If you choose to participate, your time in this research will last up to 24 months.","detailedDescription":"The purpose of this research is to gather information on the safety and effectiveness of VS-6766 in combination with cetuximab. Doctors leading this study want to find out if combining two medications (cetuximab and VS-6766) is better or worse than the usual approach for the treatment of colorectal cancer. The usual approach for treating colorectal cancer after it progresses involves chemotherapies like Fluorouracil (5-FU), oxaliplatin, irinotecan and possibly a medication like bevacizumab. This study will instead combine cetuximab and VS-6766 to find out if the two medications can help people living with advanced colorectal cancers with certain mutations (differences) called KRAS mutations."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Colorectal Cancer","Colorectal Adenocarcinoma","Colorectal Cancer Metastatic","Advanced Colorectal Carcinoma","Advanced Colorectal Adenocarcinoma"],"keywords":["colorectal cancer","advanced colorectal cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":53,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Phase 1(Dose-Finding Arm): Group 1 - Dose Level 1 (Starting Dose)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This study will use two dose levels (a starting dose at level 1 and a second dose highest dose at level 2) of the VS-6766 and cetuximab regimen.

Recently, two new drugs that seem to work together have been shown to have promising treatment effects in tissue culture and animal models of glioblastoma. Each inhibits a different glioblastoma growth pathway and when used together may create a larger effect on tumor growth than either alone. Growth pathway describes a series of chemical reactions in which a group of molecules in a cell work together to control cell growth. It is known that glioblastoma tumor cells can grow because of lack of regulation. Both Pyk2 and the closely related kinase (FAK) proteins help regulate tumor cell invasion, unless they are produced in large amounts (over expressed). Specifically, Raf and FAK/Pyk2 regulation of cell division is activated quite a bit more in gliomas compared to normal tissues. Recently developed inhibitors of Raf (VS-6766) and FAK (defactinib) which belong to a class of medications called kinase inhibitors, are aimed to bring their activity to proper levels and may stop tumor growth.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Estimate (or characterize) the concentration of defactinib or avutometinib (VS-6766) that accumulates in the glioblastoma (GBM) and brain around tumor.\n\nII.

Assess the inhibition of Pyk2/FAK or MEK, Erk signaling in tumor and brain around tumor.\n\nIV.

Glioblastoma is the major form of brain cancer in people over 50 years old. Pediatric cases of glioblastoma are relatively rare. Besides this, there are crucial molecular differences between adult and pediatric gliomas. Our preliminary data for proposed investigation were obtained on GBM specimens and cultures developed from GBM tissues donated by adult subjects. Results of investigation of adult glioma tissue cannot simply be extrapolated to children. Therefore, our primary research focus is the investigation of GBM in adults.
