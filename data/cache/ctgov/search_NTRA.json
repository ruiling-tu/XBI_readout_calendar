Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Chemotherapy drugs, such as leucovorin, fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving short-course radiation therapy and combination chemotherapy may reduce the need for surgery and therefore improve quality of life.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Complete clinical response (cCR) rate of patients with clinical T3 and/or node-positive M0 rectal cancer being treated with short-course radiation therapy (SCRT) followed by 16 weeks of modified leucovorin, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX)/capecitabine and oxaliplatin (CapeOX).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. 1-year local recurrence free survival and 1-year progression free survival of the entire cohort, the cohort that initially undergoes non-operative management (NOM), and the cohort that initially undergoes total mesorectal excision (TME).\n\nII. Physician-reported acute and late \\>= grade 3 toxicity rates. III. 1-year post-treatment patient health-related quality of life and anorectal function as per Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement and Information System (PROMIS).\n\nIV. Explore how Signatera's residual disease test correlates with patient's cCR rates, local recurrence, progression-free, and overall survival rates.\n\nV. Explore radiomics features from longitudinal diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (diffusion weighted imaging \\[DWI\\]) data and build a predictive model for treatment effect (complete response) in rectal cancer patients undergoing SCRT.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo SCRT in the form of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) over 5 fractions daily for 5 consecutive days. Beginning 11-18 days after the last day of radiation therapy, patients receive either oxaliplatin intravenously (IV) and leucovorin IV on day 1 and fluorouracil IV on days 1-3 (mFOLFOX6) or oxaliplatin IV on day 1 and capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14 (CapeOX). Treatment with mFOLFOX6 repeats every 2 weeks for up to 8 cycles, and treatment with CapeOX repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Those diagnosed early will generally have neoadjuvant treatment with FLOT chemotherapy followed by surgery followed by the same FLOT chemotherapy post surgery. Treatment however is curative in less than 50%.\n\nCirculating tumour DNA (ctDNA) is found in the bloodstream. It refers to DNA that comes from cancerous cells and tumours. If ctDNA is positive it means that there are microscopic traces of tumour in the bloodstream (minimal residual disease). Patients who are ctDNA positive after chemotherapy and surgery are less likely to benefit from further FLOT chemotherapy and more likely to relapse.\n\nHER2 positive describes cells that have a protein called HER2 on their surface. In normal cells, HER2 helps control cell growth. Cancer cells that make too much HER2 may grow more quickly and are more likely to spread to other parts of the body.\n\nTrastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) is an antibody that targets HER2 cells. It attaches to the HER2 cells on the tumour and destroys them. In the UK, trastuzumab deruxtecan (Enhertu) is currently offered to patients with advanced breast cancer who are HER2 positive. In the US, Israel and Japan it is licenced in patients with advanced HER2 positive GOA.\n\nDECIPHER aims to treat patient's with GOA post-surgery who are both HER2 and ctDNA positive with trastuzumab deruxtecan (Enhertu) instead of standard care FLOT chemotherapy. The aim of the trial is to treat the minimal residual disease reducing the chance of relapse. All trial patients will be followed for up to 2 years to record their response to treatment. 25 patients will be recruited over 18 months.\n\nPatients will be treated with 6.4 mg/kg trastuzumab deruxtecan every 21 days for 8 cycles."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Gastrooesophageal Cancer"],"keywords":["Gastrooesophageal adenocarcinoma","Oesophageal cancer","Gastric cancer","HER2","ctDNA","Minimal residual disease"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":25,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Trastuzumab deruxtecan","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants in the study will be treated with trastuzumab deruxtecan at a dose of 6.4 mg/kg intravenously every 21 days for 8 cycles.

This has considerable error rates, many due to the high disagreement among pathologists in assessing lesions and diagnoses. To address the unmet need for precision and accuracy, the Alberta Transplant Applied Genomics Centre (ATAGC, University of Alberta) has developed a new diagnostic system - the Molecular Microscope® Diagnostic System (MMDx), which uses microarrays to define the global gene expression features of rejection and injury. Now a new screening test is being introduced: the monitoring of donor-derived cell-free DNA (DD-cfDNA) released in the blood by the heart during rejection. The Natera Inc DD-cfDNA Prospera® test is based on the massively multiplex polymerase chain reaction that targets 13,392 single nucleotide polymorphisms and targeted sequences are quantified by Next Generation Sequencing. The Prospera® test has been done on kidney transplant recipients and detected \"active rejection\" and differentiated it from borderline rejection and no rejection. However, Prospera® test was not examined (the DD-cfDNA results) in heart transplant recipients. DD-cf-DNA test for heart transplants must now be calibrated against MMDx that is based on global gene expression, the new standard for biopsy interpretation. The present study will calibrate centrally measured (Natera Inc) DD-cfDNA levels obtained at the time of an indication or protocol biopsy against the MMDx measurements of T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR), antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) and early and late tissue injury. The present study will compare DD-cfDNA and MMDx in 300 prospectively collected biopsies for clinical indications and protocol, and accompanying 600 blood samples, to calibrate the DD-cfDNA (Natera Inc.) levels against the MMDx biopsy diagnoses of TCMR, ABMR (and its stages), and acute (early) and chronic (late) injury, , as well as central assessment of HLA antibody (One Lambda) in 300 blood samples, interpreted centrally as donor specific antibody (DSA) based on the tissue typing results. Trifecta-Heart collected 658 biopsies, 609 cfDNA samples and 640 One Lambda samples so far. Due to a considerable interest from participation centers, this study aims to collect 300 more biopsies and corresponding blood samples.

This has considerable error rates, many due to the high disagreement among pathologists. There is a need for new methods of assessing TBBs. Furthermore, by analyzing different types of biopsies (TBBs and endobronchial - 3BMBs), we hope to improve the safety of the biopsy procedure, while maintaining its accuracy. The emergence of blood donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) measurement offers a new opportunity for screening for rejection. To address the unmet need for precision and accuracy, the Alberta Transplant Applied Genomics Centre (ATAGC, University of Alberta) has developed a new diagnostic system - the Molecular Microscope® Diagnostic System (MMDx), which uses microarrays to define the genome-wide gene expression and interpret lung transplant rejection and injury ((chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) related changes)). Now a new screening test is being introduced: the monitoring of dd-cfDNA released in the blood by the heart during rejection. The Natera Inc dd-cfDNA Prospera® test is based on the massively multiplex polymerase chain reaction that targets 13,392 single nucleotide polymorphisms and targeted sequences are quantified by Next Generation Sequencing. The Prospera® test has been done on kidney transplant recipients and detected \"active rejection\" and differentiated it from borderline rejection and no rejection. However, Prospera® test was not examined (the dd-cfDNA results) in lung transplant recipients. dd-cf-DNA test for lung transplants must now be calibrated against MMDx that is based on global gene expression, the new standard for biopsy interpretation. The present study will calibrate centrally measured (Natera Inc) dd-cfDNA levels obtained at the time of an indication or protocol biopsy against the MMDx measurements of T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR), antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR-like) and tissue injury. The present study will compare dd-cfDNA and MMDx in 600 prospectively collected TBBs and 3BMBs for clinical indications and protocol, and accompanying 1800 blood samples, to calibrate the dd-cfDNA (Natera Inc.) levels against the MMDx biopsy diagnoses of TCMR, ABMR-like (and its stages), and injury, as well as central assessment of Human Leukocyte Antibody (HLA) antibody (One Lambda), interpreted centrally as donor specific antibody (DSA) based on the tissue typing results. This study is an extension of the INTERLUNG ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02812290.\n\nCurrently the study accrued 108 paired TBBs and 3BMBs, 9 TBBs, and 64 corresponding blood samples for dd-cfDNA test."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Lung Transplantation"],"keywords":["Donor derived cfDNA","Gene expression","Lung transplant biopsy","Blood"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"RNA isolated from patient biopsy cfDNA isolated from patient blood"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":600,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Calibration of Prospera® test for T cell mediated rejection","description":"Set dd-cfDNA test cut-off values against the probability of T cell-mediated rejection in the biopsy (TBB and 3BMB) as reported by MMDx.

Patients with kidney transplants are routinely tested (creatinine, urine protein, histology and donor specific antibody (DSA) as standard of care to detect rejection, but these tests are not adequate. Rejection is often missed by these tests (false negatives) and other processes such as acute kidney injury can produce false-positive results. Moreover, histology has a high interobserver disagreement diagnosing rejection, and cannot accurately assess acute injury. A definitive molecular assessment of rejection and injury in kidney biopsies has emerged - the Molecular Microscope® Diagnostic System (MMDx) - developed by the Alberta Transplant Applied Genomics Centre, University of Alberta. Now a new screening test is being introduced: the monitoring of donor-derived cell-free DNA (DD-cfDNA) released in the blood by the kidney during rejection. The Natera Inc DD-cfDNA Prospera® test is based on the massively multiplex PCR that targets 13,392 single nucleotide polymorphisms and targeted sequences are quantified by Next Generation Sequencing. The Prospera® test done on kidney transplant recipients detected \"active rejection\" and differentiated it from borderline rejection and no rejection. It is likely, however, that DD-cfDNA test may miss some T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR) cases and the distinction between early and fully developed antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) was not tested. No study has actually examined the DD-cfDNA results in kidney transplants with acute or chronic kidney disease (AKI and CKD). DD-cfDNA measurements have only been correlated with histology, a flawed standard. DD-cf-DNA test must now be calibrated against MMDx that is based on global gene expression, the new standard for biopsy interpretation. The present study will calibrate centrally measured (Natera Inc) DD-cfDNA levels obtained at the time of an indication biopsy against the MMDx measurements of TCMR, and ABMR (early-stage, fully-developed, and late-stage), AK, and atrophy-fibrosis. We will compare blood DD-cfDNA measurements in 600 samples at the time of 300 indication biopsies to the MMDx results, as well as central assessment of HLA antibody (One Lambda) in 300 blood samples, interpreted centrally as DSA based on the tissue typing results.
