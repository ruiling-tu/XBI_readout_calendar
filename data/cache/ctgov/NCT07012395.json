The study will progress in two parts.\n\nPart A is the open-label portion of the study assessing safety and preliminary efficacy of monotherapies.\n\nPart B, which will be open for enrollment after Part A, is the randomized, placebo-controlled portion of the study assessing the safety and efficacy of the 6 interventions (3 monotherapies and 3 combinations) compared to placebo.\n\nIntervention arms will be added to the study over time and may complete at different times."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ulcerative Colitis","Inflammatory Bowel Diseases","Colitis","Colitis, Ulcerative"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":645,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention Specific Appendix -
