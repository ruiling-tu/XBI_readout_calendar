At least one of the failed treatments should be an immunosuppressive or biologic standard-of care agent.\n* If on corticosteroid and/or antimalarial, the dose must be stable prior to day 1.\n* Laboratory parameters including the following:\n\n  * Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) ≥0.5 x 109/L\n  * Peripheral B cell count ≥25 cells/µL\n  * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.0 x 109/L\n  * Hemoglobin ≥8 g/dL\n  * Platelet count ≥75 x 109/L.\n  * Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (based on CKD-EPI formula) ≥30 mL/min/1.73m2\n  * Total bilirubin ≤1.5 × ULN, except patients with confirmed Gilbert's Syndrome\n  * Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤2.5 × ULN\n* Part B only: For patients who were treated in Part A and did not experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) or discontinue CLN-978 treatment due to AEs are eligible for retreatment at a higher dose or longer schedule in Part B if they otherwise meet eligibility criteria and at least 90 days have passed since the last dose of CLN-978.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Active inflammatory disease other than SLE.
