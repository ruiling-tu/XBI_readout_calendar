The study is focused on patients who have relapse/refractory aggressive B-cell lymphoma. The aim of the study is to see how safe and tolerable the study drugs are, and to define the recommended dose regimen for the combination with odronextamab.\n\nThis study is also looking at several other research questions, including:\n\n* What side effects may happen from taking the study drugs\n* How effective the study drugs are against the disease\n* How much study drug is in the blood at different times\n* Whether the body makes substances or protein called antibodies against the study drugs (that could make the drugs less effective or could lead to side effects)"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Relapsed/Refractory Aggressive B-Cell Lymphoma"],"keywords":["B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (B-NHL)"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":105,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Dose escalation phase","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Safety assessment of odronextamab in combination with cemiplimab and selection of recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) regimen(s) for the combination of odronextamab and cemiplimab.","interventionNames":["Drug: cemiplimab","Drug: odronextamab"]},{"label":"Dose expansion phase","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"RP2D administration of the combination treatment.","interventionNames":["Drug: cemiplimab","Drug: odronextamab"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"cemiplimab","description":"Administration via intravenous (IV) infusion.
