After washout, patients will begin bezuclastinib and add sunitinib 2 weeks later. Patients will continue on treatment until progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. Patients may stay on treatment beyond progression if there is clinical benefit in the opinion of the investigator. Imaging response assessments will be performed every 8 weeks until the participant reaches 15 months on study. After 15 months, response assessments may be performed every 3 months. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) will be collected at baseline, with sequential initiation of bezuclastinib and sunitinib, at the first response assessment, and at the time of progression. In a subset of 20 patients, PET/CT will be performed at baseline and with sequential initiation of bezuclastinib and sunitinib, and tumor biopsies will be performed on cycle 2 day 1 for correlative studies. EORTC QLQ-C30 will be administered during the study to assess patient-reported quality of life."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors","GIST"],"keywords":["GIST","Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors","Sarcoma","Sunitinib","Bezuclastinib","exon 11 or exon 9 primary KIT mutation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"bezuclastinib in combination with sunitinib","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Bezuclastinib 600 mg (tablet) administered orally daily Sunitinib 37.5 mg administered orally daily\n\nPatients will begin bezuclastinib and add sunitinib 2 weeks later.
