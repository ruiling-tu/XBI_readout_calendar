The study is focused on a type of skin cancer known as cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC).\n\nThe aim of the study is to see if cemiplimab or cemiplimab in combination with fianlimab can eliminate or reduce the number of living cancer cells in tumor(s) if taken before surgery.\n\nThe study is looking at several other research questions, including:\n\n* Whether taking cemiplimab or cemiplimab in combination with fianlimab before surgery may make it possible to have a less extensive surgery or a different treatment plan after surgery\n* Whether taking cemiplimab or cemiplimab in combination with fianlimab before surgery may make the cancer less likely to come back after surgery\n* What side effects may happen from taking the cemiplimab or cemiplimab in combination with fianlimab\n* How much of the cemiplimab or cemiplimab in combination with fianlimab is in the blood at different times\n* Whether the body makes antibodies against the study drug(s) (which could make the drug(s) less effective or could lead to side effects)"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma"],"keywords":["Neoadjuvant","Adjuvant","Surgery"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"cemiplimab","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: cemiplimab"]},{"label":"fianlimab+cemiplimab","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: cemiplimab","Drug: fianlimab"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"cemiplimab","description":"Administered Intravenous (IV) infusion every three weeks (Q3W)","armGroupLabels":["cemiplimab","fianlimab+cemiplimab"],"otherNames":["REGN2810","Libtayo"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"fianlimab","description":"IV infusion Q3W","armGroupLabels":["fianlimab+cemiplimab"],"otherNames":["REGN3767"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Pathological complete response (pCR) rate by blinded independent pathological review (BIPR)","timeFrame":"Up to 100 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"pCR rate by local pathological review","timeFrame":"Up to 100 days"},{"measure":"Major pathological response (MPR)","timeFrame":"Up to 100 days"},{"measure":"Event-free survival (EFS)","timeFrame":"Up to 3 years"},{"measure":"Disease free survival (DFS)","timeFrame":"Up to 3 years"},{"measure":"Objective response rate (ORR) prior to surgery","timeFrame":"Up to 100 days"},{"measure":"Overall survival (OS)","timeFrame":"Up to 3 years"},{"measure":"Occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs)","timeFrame":"Up to 3 years"},{"measure":"Occurrence of immune-mediated adverse events (imAEs)","timeFrame":"Up to 3 years"},{"measure":"Occurrence of treatment-related TEAEs","timeFrame":"Up to 3 years"},{"measure":"Occurrence of adverse event of special interest (AESI)","timeFrame":"Up to 3 years"},{"measure":"Occurrence of treatment-emergent serious adverse events (SAEs)","timeFrame":"Up to 3 years"},{"measure":"Occurrence of laboratory abnormalities","description":"Per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) v5.0","timeFrame":"Up to 3 years"},{"measure":"Occurrence of death due to TEAE","timeFrame":"Up to 3 years"},{"measure":"Occurrence of interruption of study drug(s) due to TEAEs","timeFrame":"Up to 3 years"},{"measure":"Occurrence of discontinuation of study drug(s) due to TEAEs","timeFrame":"Up to 3 years"},{"measure":"Occurrence of cancellation of surgery due to TEAE","timeFrame":"Up to 100 days"},{"measure":"Occurrence of delay to surgery due to TEAE","timeFrame":"Up to 100 days"},{"measure":"Concentrations of cemiplimab in serum","timeFrame":"Up to 3 years"},{"measure":"Concentrations of fianlimab in serum","timeFrame":"Up to 3 years"},{"measure":"Concentrations of other experimental agents (as applicable) in serum","timeFrame":"Up to 3 years"},{"measure":"Incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) to cemiplimab","timeFrame":"Up to 3 years"},{"measure":"Incidence of ADA to fianlimab","timeFrame":"Up to 3 years"},{"measure":"Incidence of ADA to other experimental agents (as applicable)","timeFrame":"Up to 3 years"},{"measure":"Titer of ADA to cemiplimab","timeFrame":"Up to 3 years"},{"measure":"Titer of ADA to fianlimab","timeFrame":"Up to 3 years"},{"measure":"Titer of ADA to other experimental agents (as applicable)","timeFrame":"Up to 3 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Key Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
