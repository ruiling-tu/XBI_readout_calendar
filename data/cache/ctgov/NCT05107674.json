Phase 1a dose escalation will evaluate the safety and tolerability of NX-1607 in adult patients with advanced solid tumors for which standard therapy with proven clinical benefit does not exist, is no longer effective, or is not appropriate. Indications for monotherapy include platinum resistant epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), gastric/gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC), recurrent and either metastatic or unresectable melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer, cervical cancer, and microsatellite stable colorectal cancer (MSS CRC), and diffuse large cell B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) including patients with Richter transformation (DLBCL-RT). Indications for paclitaxel combo may include, but are not limited to, platinum-resistant EOC, gastric/GEJ cancer, HNSCC, NSCLC, TNBC, locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer, and cervical cancer at the Sponsor's discretion.\n\nPhase 1b will investigate the efficacy of NX-1607 as monotherapy or in combination with paclitaxel at the dose(s) selected in Phase 1a in select advanced malignancies for which standard therapy, including immunotherapy, with proven clinical benefit does not exist, is no longer effective, or is not appropriate. Indications include platinum-resistant EOC, including primary peritoneal and fallopian tube carcinoma, advanced gastric/GEJ cancer, HNSCC, recurrent and either metastatic or unresectable melanoma, advanced NSCLC, mCRPC, MSS CRC, mixed solid tumor cohort indications consisting of patients with MPM, TNBC, locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer, cervical cancer, and DLBCL including patients with DLBCL-RT. In Arm 1 (NX-1607 monotherapy), more than 1 dose level of NX-1607 may be tested in individual indications, each of which will constitute a separate cohort in Phase 1b."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ovarian Cancer, Epithelial","Gastric Cancer","GastroEsophageal Junction (GEJ) Cancer","Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma","Metastatic or Unresectable Melanoma","Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)","Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC)","Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM)","Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)","Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma","Cervical Cancer","Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)","Richter Transformation","Microsatellite Stable Colorectal Carcinoma"],"keywords":["Ubiquitin Ligase Inhibitor","Advanced Malignancies","T-cell Activation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":345,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Phase 1a Dose Escalation of NX-1607 (monotherapy)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Multiple dose levels and dosing regimen of NX-1607 to be evaluated; determination of MTD/Phase 1b recommended dose.","interventionNames":["Drug: NX-1607"]},{"label":"Phase 1a Food Effect","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Impact of food on NX-1607 bioavailability and tolerability to be evaluated","interventionNames":["Drug: NX-1607"]},{"label":"Phase 1b Dose Expansion in platinum-resistant EOC","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients with platinum-resistant EOC, including primary peritoneal and fallopian tube carcinoma","interventionNames":["Drug: NX-1607"]},{"label":"Phase 1b Dose Expansion in advanced gastric/GEJ cancer","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients with recurrent, locally advanced, or metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma","interventionNames":["Drug: NX-1607"]},{"label":"Phase 1b Dose Expansion in HNSCC","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients with recurrent, locally advanced, or metastatic HNSCC","interventionNames":["Drug: NX-1607"]},{"label":"Phase 1b Dose Expansion in recurrent melanoma","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients with recurrent and either metastatic or unresectable Melanoma","interventionNames":["Drug: NX-1607"]},{"label":"Phase 1b Dose Expansion in advanced NSCLC","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients with Stage IV NSCLC","interventionNames":["Drug: NX-1607"]},{"label":"Phase 1b Dose Expansion in mCRPC","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients with mCRPC who received a minimum of 2 prior lines of therapy in the advanced setting including androgen receptor-directed therapy and a taxane-based chemotherapy and has PSA or radiographic progression","interventionNames":["Drug: NX-1607"]},{"label":"Phase 1b Dose Expansion in mixed solid tumor cohort","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Cohort of mixed solid tumor indications consisting of patients with MPM, TNBC, locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer, cervical cancer, or DLBCL/DLBCL-RT","interventionNames":["Drug: NX-1607"]},{"label":"Phase 1a Dose Escalation of NX-1607 in combination with Paclitaxel","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Indications may include but are not limited to, platinum resistant EOC, gastric/GEJ cancer.
