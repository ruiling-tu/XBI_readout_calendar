The eligible study participants will be randomly divided into two groups: 1. the group receiving structured mental health support with a social worker and 2. the group receiving structured mental health support via a self-directed online curriculum. Both groups will be receiving the same type of therapy, Healing Circuits™, but the group receiving the therapy via the online self-directed curriculum will be receiving the therapy mostly by web-based video instruction. The two groups will be evaluated over a period of 12 months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Crohn Disease (CD)","Ulcerative Colitis (UC)","Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)"],"keywords":["Healing Circuits"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Sessions with a social worker based on Healing Circuits™ Methodology","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Healing Circuits™ sessions"]},{"label":"Online modules of a self-directed Healing Circuits™ curriculum","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Behavioral: self-directed Healing Circuits™ curriculum"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Healing Circuits™ sessions","description":"Treatment of the Study group will involve 12-weekly 50-minute sessions with a social worker who has been trained in the Healing Circuits™ Methodology - a structured mental health support delivered by a therapist in a one-on-one model.","armGroupLabels":["Sessions with a social worker based on Healing Circuits™ Methodology"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"self-directed Healing Circuits™ curriculum","description":"Treatment of the Control group will involve 12 weekly online modules of a self-directed Healing Circuits™ curriculum - structured mental health support being delivered in an web-based video instruction model.","armGroupLabels":["Online modules of a self-directed Healing Circuits™ curriculum"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale (GAD-7) Score","description":"The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD7) is a seven-item instrument that is used to measure or assess the severity of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Each item asks the individual to rate the severity of his or her symptoms over the past two weeks.

It addresses 8 health concepts: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions.\n\nThe comparison will be made between the one-on-one therapy group and the app-based therapy group at the specified time points.","timeFrame":"3, 6, 9, and 12 months following initiation of Healing Circuits™"},{"measure":"Mean Change in Patient Satisfaction Score on a Likert Scale Between Groups","description":"This outcome measures the mean difference in patient satisfaction between the one-on-one therapy group and the app-based therapy group.
