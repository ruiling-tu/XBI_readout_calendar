The investigators hypothesize that compared to patients receiving sham VR and linaclotide, IBS-C patients receiving combination therapy with active VR and linaclotide will achieve statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in disease-targeted health-related quality of life while demonstrating improvements in global IBS symptoms, including abdominal pain.\n\nAims\n\n1. Evaluate changes in quality of life using the validated IBS-QoL (primary outcome);\n2. Evaluate global improvement in IBS symptoms using the validated IBS-SSS;\n3. Assess global improvement in IBS symptoms using the validated Abdominal Scoring system (11);\n4. Evaluate improvement in abdominal pain using a numerical rating system (NRS);\n5. Assess improvement in constipation using the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS);\n6. Evaluate response to bloating using the validated Mayo bloating questionnaire (12);\n7.

Adverse events and change in disease state will be assessed.\n\nThe combination of azacitidine and venetoclax is being evaluated in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Participants will receive azacitidine with increasing doses of venetoclax. Adult participants with a diagnosis of AML will be enrolled. Around 40 participants will be enrolled in the study in approximately 30 sites in China.\n\nAt cycle 1 during ramp-up period, participants will receive venetoclax oral tablets once daily in increasing doses until the study dose is achieved on day 3. Then ventoclax oral tablets will continue once daily thereafter. Azacitidine will be given by subcutaneous injection (SC) for 7 days beginning on Day 1 of each 28-day cycle.\n\nThere may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care.

DR is a chronic and progressive complication of diabetes mellitus. It is a sight-threatening disease characterized in the early stages by neuronal and vascular dysfunction in the retina, and later by neovascularization that leads to further deterioration of functional vision. Despite the availability of current treatments, diabetic retinopathy remains the leading cause of vision loss in working-age adults, those between the ages of 20 and 74. Existing treatment with anti-VEGF agents, although shown to be effective, are limited by short therapeutic half-lives, which then require frequent intravitreal injections over the patient's lifetime, resulting in increased risk of associated adverse events and significant treatment burden. Due to the burden of treatment, patients often do not closely adhere to treatment regimens and experience sub-optimal outcomes and a decline in vision.","detailedDescription":"This phase 2, randomized, dose-escalation study is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ABBV-RGX-314 gene therapy in subjects with DR with and without center-involved diabetic macular edema (CI-DME).\n\nPart 1: For subjects with DR without CI-DME, approximately 100 participants who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled into one of 5 cohorts.

Wet AMD is characterized by loss of vision due to new, leaky blood vessel formation in the retina. Wet AMD is a significant cause of vision loss in the United States, Europe and Japan, with up to 2 million people living with wet AMD in these geographies alone. Current anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapies have significantly changed the landscape for treatment of wet AMD, becoming the standard of care due to their ability to prevent progression of vision loss in the majority of patients. These therapies, however, require life-long intraocular injections, typically repeated every four to 12 weeks in frequency, to maintain efficacy. Due to the burden of treatment, patients often experience a decline in vision with reduced frequency of treatment over time. ABBV-RGX-314 is being developed as a potential one-time treatment for wet AMD.","detailedDescription":"This randomized, partially masked, controlled, Phase 3 clinical study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of ABBV-RGX-314 gene therapy in participants with nAMD. The study will evaluate 2 dose levels of RGX-314 gene therapy relative to an active comparator. The primary endpoint of this study is mean change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of ABBV-RGX-314 relative to aflibercept. Approximately 660 participants who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria, will be enrolled into one of 3 arms.\n\nA bilateral treatment substudy conducted at US sites is an open-label, partially randomized, parallel arm study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of subretinal ABBV-RGX-314 administered bilaterally in participants who have bilateral nAMD. Previously treated crossover participants from the control arm of the main study who crossed over and received ABBV-RGX-314 in the study eye will receive the same ABBV-RGX-314 dose in the contralateral eye (ie, same dose as in the study eye), and newcomers (participants who have not been randomized in an ABBV-RGX-314 study) and untreated crossover participants (ongoing control participants in the main study who have completed Week 54 but have not crossed over to receive ABBV-RGX-314 in the main study) will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive ABBV-RGX-314 Dose 1 or ABBV-RGX-314 Dose 2 in both eyes. Up to 15 participants who qualify for the substudy will be enrolled and followed for a minimum of 50 weeks."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["AMD","nAMD","Wet Age-related Macular Degeneration","wAMD","WetAMD","CNV"],"keywords":["Age-Related Macular Degeneration","Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration","Wet Macular Degeneration","Choroidal Neovascularization","Retinal Degeneration","Retinal Diseases","Eye Diseases","Ranibizumab","Aflibercept","Angiogenesis Inhibitors","Angiogenesis Modulating Agents","Growth Substances","Physiological Effects of Drugs","Growth Inhibitors","Antineoplastic Agents","Gene Therapy","Anti-vascular endothelial grown factory therapy","Anti-VEGF therapy","Macular Degeneration"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"2 ABBV-RGX-314 treatment arms, 1 control arm (aflibercept)","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","maskingDescription":"ABBV-RGX-314 administration is performed as an outpatient surgical procedure in an operating room, while the active control, aflibercept, is administered via intravitreal injection in an office setting.

The typical treatment for nAMD is frequent injections of anti-VEGF therapy.

Wet AMD is characterized by loss of vision due to new, leaky blood vessel formation in the retina. Wet AMD is a significant cause of vision loss in the United States, Europe and Japan, with up to 2 million people living with wet AMD in these geographies alone. Current anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapies have significantly changed the landscape for treatment of wet AMD, becoming the standard of care due to their ability to maintain or prevent progression of vision loss in the majority of patients. These therapies, however, require life-long intraocular injections, typically repeated every 4 to 16 weeks in frequency, to maintain efficacy. Due to the burden of these treatments, patients often experience a decline in vision with reduced frequency of treatment over time.","detailedDescription":"This randomized, partially masked, active-controlled, Phase 2b/3 clinical study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of ABBV-RGX-314 gene therapy in participants with nAMD. The study will evaluate 2 dose levels of ABBV-RGX-314 relative to an active comparator. The primary endpoint of this study is the mean change from baseline in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of ABBV-RGX-314 relative to ranibizumab at Week 54. Approximately 630 participants who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria, will be enrolled into one of 3 arms.\n\nA bilateral treatment substudy conducted at US sites is an open-label, partially randomized, parallel arm study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of subretinal ABBV-RGX-314 administered bilaterally in participants who have bilateral nAMD. Previously treated crossover participants from the control arm of the main study who crossed over and received ABBV-RGX-314 in the study eye will receive the same ABBV-RGX-314 dose in the contralateral eye (ie, same dose as in the study eye), and newcomers (participants who have not been randomized in an ABBV-RGX-314 study) and untreated crossover participants (ongoing control participants in the main study who have completed Week 54 but have not crossed over to receive ABBV-RGX-314 in the main study) will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive ABBV-RGX-314 Dose 1 or ABBV-RGX-314 Dose 2 in both eyes. Up to 15 participants who qualify for the substudy will be enrolled and followed for a minimum of 50 weeks."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["AMD","nAMD","Wet Age-related Macular Degeneration","wAMD","Wet AMD","CNV","Neovascular AMD","Neovascular Age-related Macular Degeneration","Choroidal Neovascularization"],"keywords":["Age-Related Macular Degeneration","Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration","Macular Degeneration","Wet Macular Degeneration","Choroidal Neovascularization","Retinal Degeneration","Retinal Diseases","Eye Diseases","Ranibizumab","Angiogenesis Inhibitors","Angiogenesis Modulating Agents","Growth Substances","Physiological Effects of Drugs","Growth Inhibitors","Antineoplastic Agents","Gene therapy","Anti-vascular endothelial grown factory therapy","Anti-VEGF therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"2 ABBV-RGX-314 treatment arms, 1 control arm (ranibizumab)","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","maskingDescription":"The administration of ABBV-RGX-314 requires an outpatient surgical procedure performed in an operating room, while the active control, ranibizumab, is administered via intravitreal injection in an office setting.

Some people with MDS have a risk of the disease progressing to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and a risk of death from the disease itself. Symptoms of MDS include fatigue, shortness of breath, unusual paleness due to anemia (low red blood cell count), easy or unusual bruising, and red spots just beneath the skin caused by bleeding. The purpose of this study is to see how safe and effective venetoclax and azacitidine (AZA) combination are when compared to AZA and a placebo (contains no medicine), in participants with newly diagnosed higher-risk MDS.\n\nVenetoclax is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of MDS. The study consists of two treatment arms - In one arm, participants will receive venetoclax and AZA. In another arm, participants will receive AZA and placebo. Adult participants with newly diagnosed higher-risk MDS will be enrolled. Around 500 participants will be enrolled in approximately 220 sites worldwide.\n\nParticipants in one arm will receive oral doses of venetoclax tablet and intravenous (infusion in the vein) or subcutaneous (given under the skin) AZA solution. Participants in another arm will receive oral doses of placebo tablet and intravenous or subcutaneous AZA solution.\n\nThere may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the course of the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood and bone marrow tests, checking for side effects, and completing questionnaires."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)"],"keywords":["MDS","Myelodysplastic Syndrome","Venetoclax","Azacitidine","AZA","Venclexta"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":531,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm 1: Venetoclax + Azacitidine (AZA)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive venetoclax once daily (QD) (Days 1-14) in combination with AZA QD (7 days of the first 9 days) of each 28 day cycle.","interventionNames":["Drug: Venetoclax","Drug: Azacitidine"]},{"label":"Arm 2: Placebo + Azacitidine","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will receive placebo once daily (QD) (Days 1-14) in combination with AZA QD (7 days of the first 9 days) of each 28 day cycle.","interventionNames":["Drug: Azacitidine","Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Venetoclax","description":"Tablet: Oral","armGroupLabels":["Arm 1: Venetoclax + Azacitidine (AZA)"],"otherNames":["ABT-199","GDC-0199","Venclexta"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Azacitidine","description":"Subcutaneous (SC) or Intravenous (IV) injection","armGroupLabels":["Arm 1: Venetoclax + Azacitidine (AZA)","Arm 2: Placebo + Azacitidine"],"otherNames":["AZA"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"Tablet; Oral","armGroupLabels":["Arm 2: Placebo + Azacitidine"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Overall survival (OS)","description":"OS is defined as the number of days from the date of randomization to the date of death of any cause, or last known date to be alive.","timeFrame":"Up To 5 Years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified Overall Response (mOR)","description":"mOR \\[complete remission (CR) + marrow complete remission (mCR) + partial response (PR)\\] is defined as achieving a CR, mCR, or PR at any time point during the study per the modified International Working Group (IWG) 2006 criteria for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).","timeFrame":"Up To 5 Years"},{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Achieving Overall Hematological Improvement (HI)","description":"Overall HI is defined as achieving the response of HI-platelet or HI-neutrophil, or HI-erythroid at any time point during the study prior to post-treatment therapy per the modified IWG 2006 criteria for MDS.","timeFrame":"Up to 5 Years"},{"measure":"Complete Remission (CR)","description":"CR is defined as achieving a complete remission at any time point during the study per the modified International Working Group (IWG) 2006 criteria for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).","timeFrame":"Up To 36 Months"},{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Achieving Transfusion Independence (TI) Who are Transfusion Dependent at Baseline","description":"TI is when the participants who were transfusion dependent on red blood cell (RBC) and/or Platelet at baseline achieve transfusion independence post baseline.
