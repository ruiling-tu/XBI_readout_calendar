The study is focused on patients who have uncontrolled asthma. Asthma is a condition where the airways narrow and swell, making it difficult to breathe. Uncontrolled asthma means that patients are still having frequent symptoms while taking their current asthma medication.\n\nThe aim of the study is to see which regimen is more effective: taking dupilumab with an inhaled asthma medication or only taking a higher dose of the inhaled asthma medication. The type of asthma medication that will be used is a combination inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta-agonist (referred to as an ICS/LABA). Some patients may also receive an additional asthma medication called a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (referred to as a LAMA) if they are already receiving a LAMA.\n\nThe study is also looking at:\n\n• What side effects may happen from taking dupilumab","detailedDescription":"This study is a Phase 3b in Canada Minors will not be enrolled in Denmark"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Asthma"],"keywords":["Uncontrolled","Severe exacerbations","Type 2 Inflammation","Elevated blood eosinophils","Increased Fractional exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO)","Atopy and elevated Immunoglobulin E (IgE)"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":250,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Dupilumab + ICS/LABA","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Randomized 1:1","interventionNames":["Drug: dupilumab","Drug: ICS/LABA"]},{"label":"Placebo + ICS/LABA","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Randomized 1:1","interventionNames":["Drug: Matching Placebo","Drug: ICS/LABA"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"dupilumab","description":"Administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection","armGroupLabels":["Dupilumab + ICS/LABA"],"otherNames":["Dupixent®","REGN668","SAR231893"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Matching Placebo","description":"Administered by SC injection","armGroupLabels":["Placebo + ICS/LABA"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"ICS/LABA","description":"Administered at a blinded dose","armGroupLabels":["Dupilumab + ICS/LABA","Placebo + ICS/LABA"],"otherNames":["fluticasone","propionate/salmeterol HFA","inhalation aerosol"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Annualized severe asthma exacerbation rate","timeFrame":"Baseline through Week 52"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in pre-bronchodilator Forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1)","timeFrame":"Baseline to week 12"},{"measure":"Annualized cumulative dose of systemic corticosteroid exposure to treat severe asthma exacerbations","timeFrame":"Baseline to week 52"},{"measure":"Change in Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5)","description":"The ACQ-5 has 5 items that assess the most common asthma symptoms: 1.
