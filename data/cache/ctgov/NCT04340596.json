evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of N-803, an IL-15 superagonist, with or without combination broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs), to induce HIV-1 control during analytic treatment interruption (ATI).","detailedDescription":"This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of N-803, an IL-15 superagonist, with or without combination broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs), to induce HIV-1 control during analytic treatment interruption (ATI).\n\nParticipants will be screened for eligibility and undergo leukapheresis, and a subset will also undergo optional rectal biopsy and/or lymph node fine needle aspirations (FNAs) (Step 1).\n\nAfter pre-entry and determination of eligibility in Step 1, participants will be randomized before Step 2 entry to either the N-803 only arm (Arm A) or the N-803 with combination bNAbs arm (Arm B):\n\n* Arm A will receive a dose of N-803, 6 mcg/kg, subcutaneously 1 week after Step 2 entry and then every 3 weeks for a total of eight doses (during the first 22 weeks).\n* Arm B will receive the following (during the first 22 weeks):\n\n  * Combination bNAb at Step 2 entry with VRC07-523LS dosed at 20 mg/kg and 10-1074 dosed at 30 mg/kg, intravenously;\n  * A dose of N-803, 6 mcg/kg, subcutaneously 1 week after Step 2 entry and then every 3 weeks for a total of eight doses;\n  * A second dose of 10-1074 at week 9 of Step 2 dosed at 30 mg/kg, intravenously\n\nAfter completing randomized treatment (Step 2), participants will interrupt antiretroviral therapy (ART) (Step 3) and will be followed closely to monitor for indications for reinitiation of ART (Step 4).\n\nAfter Step 2 entry, most participants will be followed for approximately 100 weeks across the remaining three study steps (i.e., Steps 2, 3, and 4).\n\nStep 1 will last up to 90 days, Step 2 will last approximately 52 weeks (study intervention), Step 3 will last up to 24 weeks (ATI), and Step 4 will last 24 weeks (ART restart)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["HIV
