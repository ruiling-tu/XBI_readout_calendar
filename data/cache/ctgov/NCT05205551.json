Patients who are enrolled in this study should have blood drawn for Prospera™ testing at regular intervals per routine clinical care. Prospera™ test results and results of surveillance endomyocardial biopsies, laboratory testing, echocardiograms, angiography and hemodynamic monitoring performed to monitor cardiac status and for signs of transplant rejection, as well as medications and post-transplant re-vascularization and surgical procedures will be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF). Patient management decisions, even those informed by the Prospera™ test result, are made based on the individual judgment of the healthcare providers participating in the study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Heart Transplant Rejection"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"3 Years","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":411,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Primary Endpoints:","description":"Primary molecular endpoint: percent of donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) measured via the Prospera™ test.\n\nPrimary clinical endpoints:\n\n1.
