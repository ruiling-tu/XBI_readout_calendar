Some people with MDS have a risk of the disease progressing to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and a risk of death from the disease itself. Symptoms of MDS include fatigue, shortness of breath, unusual paleness due to anemia (low red blood cell count), easy or unusual bruising, and red spots just beneath the skin caused by bleeding. The purpose of this study is to see how safe and effective venetoclax and azacitidine (AZA) combination are when compared to AZA and a placebo (contains no medicine), in participants with newly diagnosed higher-risk MDS.\n\nVenetoclax is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of MDS. The study consists of two treatment arms - In one arm, participants will receive venetoclax and AZA. In another arm, participants will receive AZA and placebo. Adult participants with newly diagnosed higher-risk MDS will be enrolled. Around 500 participants will be enrolled in approximately 220 sites worldwide.\n\nParticipants in one arm will receive oral doses of venetoclax tablet and intravenous (infusion in the vein) or subcutaneous (given under the skin) AZA solution. Participants in another arm will receive oral doses of placebo tablet and intravenous or subcutaneous AZA solution.\n\nThere may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the course of the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood and bone marrow tests, checking for side effects, and completing questionnaires."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)"],"keywords":["MDS","Myelodysplastic Syndrome","Venetoclax","Azacitidine","AZA","Venclexta"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":531,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm 1: Venetoclax + Azacitidine (AZA)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive venetoclax once daily (QD) (Days 1-14) in combination with AZA QD (7 days of the first 9 days) of each 28 day cycle.","interventionNames":["Drug: Venetoclax","Drug: Azacitidine"]},{"label":"Arm 2: Placebo + Azacitidine","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will receive placebo once daily (QD) (Days 1-14) in combination with AZA QD (7 days of the first 9 days) of each 28 day cycle.","interventionNames":["Drug: Azacitidine","Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Venetoclax","description":"Tablet: Oral","armGroupLabels":["Arm 1: Venetoclax + Azacitidine (AZA)"],"otherNames":["ABT-199","GDC-0199","Venclexta"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Azacitidine","description":"Subcutaneous (SC) or Intravenous (IV) injection","armGroupLabels":["Arm 1: Venetoclax + Azacitidine (AZA)","Arm 2: Placebo + Azacitidine"],"otherNames":["AZA"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"Tablet; Oral","armGroupLabels":["Arm 2: Placebo + Azacitidine"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Overall survival (OS)","description":"OS is defined as the number of days from the date of randomization to the date of death of any cause, or last known date to be alive.","timeFrame":"Up To 5 Years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified Overall Response (mOR)","description":"mOR \\[complete remission (CR) + marrow complete remission (mCR) + partial response (PR)\\] is defined as achieving a CR, mCR, or PR at any time point during the study per the modified International Working Group (IWG) 2006 criteria for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).","timeFrame":"Up To 5 Years"},{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Achieving Overall Hematological Improvement (HI)","description":"Overall HI is defined as achieving the response of HI-platelet or HI-neutrophil, or HI-erythroid at any time point during the study prior to post-treatment therapy per the modified IWG 2006 criteria for MDS.","timeFrame":"Up to 5 Years"},{"measure":"Complete Remission (CR)","description":"CR is defined as achieving a complete remission at any time point during the study per the modified International Working Group (IWG) 2006 criteria for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).","timeFrame":"Up To 36 Months"},{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Achieving Transfusion Independence (TI) Who are Transfusion Dependent at Baseline","description":"TI is when the participants who were transfusion dependent on red blood cell (RBC) and/or Platelet at baseline achieve transfusion independence post baseline.
