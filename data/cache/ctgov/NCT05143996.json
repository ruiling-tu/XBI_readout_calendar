Patient has a confirmed diagnosis of recurrent or refractory AML or MDS.\n4. Patient has received, and has progressed, recurred, or is intolerant of approved therapeutic options that are available, or declines treatment with these therapies.\n5. White blood cell (WBC) count at the time of the first dose is \\< 20,000/uL (hydroxyurea is permitted according to standard institutional practice). Following first dose, WBC should be checked prior to subsequent CLN-049 administration and if WBC \\> 20,000/μL, CLN-049 treatment should be postponed (see Section 6.1 for further guidance).\n6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status is 0 to 2.\n7. Toxicities related to prior study therapy should have resolved to Grade 1 or less according to criteria of NCI CTCAE v5.0, except for alopecia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia. Patients with chronic but stable toxicities may be allowed to enroll after agreement between the Investigator and Sponsor.\n8. The patient's laboratory values meet the following criteria:\n\n   1. Creatinine clearance (CrCl) as calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula (Appendix 1) must be ≥ 60 mL/min;\n   2. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN. This does not apply for patients with confirmed Gilbert's Syndrome, hemolysis, or chronic blood transfusions, for whom total bilirubin must be less than 3.0 mg/dL with a conjugated bilirubin less than 0.5 mg/dL;\n   3. AST and ALT ≤ 3.0 × ULN (unless attributed to leukemic involvement).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)\n2. Active central nervous system (CNS) leukemia. For patients with a history of CNS leukemia, a lumbar puncture should be performed during screening to exclude the presence of active CNS involvement.\n3. Isolated extramedullary relapse\n4. Prior organ allograft\n5. Allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation within six months of treatment, or with clinical or laboratory evidence of GVHD, or requiring ongoing treatment with immune suppression within 2 months of the first dose of CLN-049.\n6.

Radiation therapy (XRT) within 28 days of the first dose of CLN049, or craniospinal XRT within 8 weeks of the first dose of CLN-049, or history of total body irradiation (TBI).\n   2. Prior immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors ≤ 42 days prior to the first dose of CLN-049.\n   3. Prior history of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR-T) cell therapy or other modified T cell therapy.\n   4. Anti-leukemic therapy except hydroxyurea for cytoreduction, and intrathecal chemotherapy ≤ 14 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, prior to the first dose of CLN-049.\n   5. Short-acting hematopoietic growth factors ≤ 7 days prior to the first dose of CLN-049\n   6. Long-acting growth factors ≤ 14 days prior to the first dose of CLN-049.\n   7.

The transient use of corticosteroids for transfusion premedication or the treatment of infusion or transfusion reactions will not be considered for this criterion. Topical corticosteroids and steroid eye drops are allowed, and will not exclude the patient from eligibility.\n   8. Prior treatment with a FLT3-directed bispecific molecule, or a FLT3-targeted antibody.\n7. Currently participating/previously participated in an interventional study and received an investigational drug within 14 days (or five half-lives, whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of CLN-049.\n8. Patients with concomitant second malignancies requiring active treatment in the past 12 months, or if additional therapy is required or anticipated during study participation.\n9.
