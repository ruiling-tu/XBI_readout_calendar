Patients receive escalating doses of a GSPT1 molecular glue degrader MRT-2359 to determine safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of MRT-2359. Once the MTD and/or RP2D is identified, additional patients enroll to Phase 2 study, which includes molecular biomarkers stratification or selection, namely expression or amplification of L-MYC and N-MYC genes, hormone receptor positive (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer and prostate cancer.","detailedDescription":"This Phase 1/2, open-label, multicenter, dose escalation and expansion study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and preliminary clinical activity of MRT-2359 in patients with previously treated selected solid tumors, including lung cancer (NSCLC and SCLC), high-grade neuroendocrine cancer of any primary site, and DLBCL.\n\n* The primary aim of Phase 1 part is safety, tolerability, MTD and/or RP2D of MRT-2359.\n* The primary aim of Phase 2 part is assessment of preliminary anti-tumor activity of MRT-2359."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["NSCLC","SCLC","High Grade Neuroendocrine Cancer","DLBCL","L-MYC and N-MYC Amplified Solid Tumors","NSCLC With High or Low L-MYC or N-MYC Expression","HR-positive, HER2-negative Breast Cancer","Prostate Cancer"],"keywords":["Small Cell Lung Cancer","Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","L-MYC Amplification","N-MYC Amplification","L-MYC expression","N-MYC expression","High-grade neuroendocrine","Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma","Molecular glue degrader","Anti-tumor","GSPT1","HR-positive","HER2-negative","Breast Cancer","Prostate Cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Single Group","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE","maskingDescription":"None (Open Label)"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":174,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Phase 1 Dose Escalation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients with NSCLC, SCLC, high-grade neuroendocrine cancer of any primary site, any solid tumors with L-MYC or N-MYC amplification, or DLBCL","interventionNames":["Drug: Oral MRT-2359"]},{"label":"Phase 2 Expansion -
