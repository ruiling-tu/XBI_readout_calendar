The key objectives of this study are to determine if VRDN-003 is safe and tolerable and to see how the body reacts to VRDN-003 when administered as a series of subcutaneous (SC) injections every 4 weeks or every 8 weeks in participants with TED either via autoinjector or via vial and syringe."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Thyroid Eye
