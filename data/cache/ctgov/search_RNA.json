Cohort B comprises a placebo-controlled, nested single ascending dose (SAD)/multiple ascending dose (MAD) cohort (Cohort B1). Cohort C comprises a randomized, placebo-controlled, expansion cohort (Cohort C1). For each of Cohorts A, B, and C the study duration is 12 months as the active treatment period is approximately 9 months for Cohorts A \\& B and approximately 10 months for Cohort C followed by a 12-week follow-up period for Cohorts A \\& B and a 7-week follow-up period for Cohort C. Once participants have completed active treatment with follow-up through 12 months, they may have the option to participate in a planned open-label extension. If patients do not enroll in the open-label extension, they will be followed for 12-weeks after their last dose of study medication."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["FSHD","FSHD1","FSHD2","FMD","FMD2","Fascioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy","Fascioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy Type 1","Fascioscapulohumeral
