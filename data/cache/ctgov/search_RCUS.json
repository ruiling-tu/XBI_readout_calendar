Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as zimberelimab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Quemliclustat acts as a blocker for adenosine. Adenosine is a chemical produced in the body that can lead to a decrease in the immune system's response towards cancer. Quemliclustat has the potential to decrease the amount of adenosine, allowing the immune system to recognize and act against the cancer. Chemotherapy drugs, such as oxaliplatin, irinotecan, leucovorin, and fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving chemotherapy in combination with zimberelimab and quemliclustat may kill more cancer cells than chemotherapy alone.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the safety, tolerability and resection rate (for borderline resectable pancreatic cancer \\[BRPC\\] cohort) or progression free survival (PFS) (for locally advanced pancreatic cancer \\[LAPC\\] cohort) in patients with borderline resectable pancreatic cancer (BRPC) or locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) treated with modified fluorouracil, irinotecan, leucovorin and oxaliplatin (mFOLFIRINOX), quemliclustat, and zimberelimab.\n\nII. To evaluate development of clinically relevant pancreatic fistula (for BRPC cohort) in the post-operative period after neoadjuvant treatment with mFOLFIRINOX, quemliclustat, and zimberelimab.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To estimate efficacy as measured by decreases in CA 19-9 and objective response rate (ORR) by imaging (unconfirmed complete and partial responses).\n\nII. To estimate the pathologic complete response rate (pCR) (for BRPC cohort) and overall survival (OS).\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the effects of zimberelimab, quemliclustat, and modified FOLFIRINOX (mFFX) on the tumor-stromal cells comparing pre-treatment core biopsies with operative specimens and on the effects on T cell infiltration, PD1 expression and the tumor microenvironment (TME).\n\nII. To investigate potential serum and tumor predictive biomarkers to predict response to experimental therapy.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive zimberelimab intravenously (IV), quemliclustat IV, oxaliplatin IV, leucovorin calcium IV, and inrinotecan IV on study.

Per this definition, locally advanced PDAC is defined as presence of any one or more of the following on CT;\n\n    * Occlusion of the SMV-PV that is not amenable to resection and venous reconstruction\n    * Interface between tumor and hepatic artery that is not amenable to resection and reconstruction\n    * Interface between the tumor and SMA measuring \\> 180 degrees of the circumference of the vessel wall\n    * Interface between the tumor and celiac axis measuring \\> 180 degrees of the circumference of the vessel wall\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \\>= 1.5 x 10\\^9/L\n* Platelets \\>= 100 x 10\\^9/L\n* Hemoglobin \\>= 9 g/dL\n* Serum creatinine (sCr) =\\< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or Creatinine clearance (Ccr) \\>= 40 mL/min (as calculated by Modified Cockcroft-Gault formula)\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (AST/\\[SGOT\\]) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase \\[SGPT\\]) =\\< 2.5 X ULN\n* Women with no childbearing potential because of surgery or who are at least 1 year postmenopausal (ie, 12 months post last menstrual period) or with menopause confirmed by follicle-stimulating hormone testing\n* Women of childbearing potential must use an effective nonhormonal method of contraception (intrauterine device or intrauterine system; condom or occlusive cap \\[diaphragm or cervical or vault caps\\] with spermicidal foam or gel or film or cream or suppository; or vasectomized male partner if he is the sole partner of that participant) for the duration of the study and for up to 6 months after the last dose of zimberelimab or quemliclustat\n* Male participants must use an effective method of contraception (condom or occlusive cap \\[diaphragm or cervical or vault caps\\] with spermicidal foam or gel or film or cream or suppository, or vasectomy) throughout the study and for up to 6 months after the last dose of zimberelimab or quemliclustat\n* Immunosuppressive doses of systemic medications, such as corticosteroids or absorbed topical corticosteroids (doses \\> 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) must be discontinued at least 2 weeks (14 days) before study treatment administration. Physiologic doses of corticosteroids (=\\< 10 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent) or short pulses of corticosteroids (=\\< 3 days) may be permitted\n* Prior surgery that required general anesthesia or other major surgery as defined by the Investigator must be completed at least 4 weeks before study treatment administration.

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. IL-6 is expressed by prostate cancer and within the tumor microenvironment and shown to enhance prostate cancer and disease progression. Treatment with an anti-IL-6 antibody such as tocilizumab may inhibit cancer progression. Giving atezolizumab in combination with etrumadenant or tocilizumab may work better in treating prostate cancer.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI.

Hence, methods to improve the local curative potential of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a timely and important opportunity. In addition, previous data suggest that the adenosine A2A pathway may be a particularly attractive avenue for intervention in the context of radiation, thus influencing multiple suppressive populations within the tumor microenvironment (TME).\n\nImmunotherapy based on the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling axis is a mainstay of therapy across multiple types of malignancies. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a PD-1 inhibitor (zimberelimab) in combination with a selective dual antagonist of A2aR and A2bR (etrumadenant) and an anti-CD73 (quemliclustat). Immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted inhibitors of the adenosine signaling axis modulate the TME and aspects of the systemic immune system to overcome tumor-induced immune suppression and improve responses to therapy.\n\nThis study aims to determine the effect of etrumadenant, quemliclustat and zimberelimab \\[experimental\\] when given with ablative radiation (SBRT)\\[standard of care\\] on the oligoprogressive disease (hormone sensitive oligometastatic prostate cancer), defined by being free from radiographic progression of irradiated target metastases and PSA (prostate surface antigen) response at 6 months. PSA response, local control, progression-free survival (PFS), treatment response, ADT-free survival, time-to-pain, and safety and tolerability will also be measured.
