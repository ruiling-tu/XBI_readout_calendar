The trial is looking at several other research questions, including:\n\n* What side effects may happen from taking the experimental drug?\n* How much experimental drug is in the blood at different times?\n* Whether the body makes antibodies against the experimental drug (which could make the drug less effective or could lead to side effects).\n* What is the best dose of the experimental drug?"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Healthy Volunteer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":56,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"ALN-F1202","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Randomized as described in the protocol Escalating Cohorts including Optional Cohorts","interventionNames":["Drug: ALN-F1202"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Randomized as described in the protocol","interventionNames":["Drug: Matching Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"ALN-F1202","description":"Administered per the protocol","armGroupLabels":["ALN-F1202"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Matching Placebo","description":"Administered per the protocol","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Incidence of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)","timeFrame":"Up to 190 Days"},{"measure":"Severity of TEAEs","timeFrame":"Up to 190 Days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT)","timeFrame":"Baseline up to 190 Days"},{"measure":"Change in Prothrombin Time (PT)","timeFrame":"Baseline up to 190 Days"},{"measure":"Concentration of combined ALN-F1202 and metabolites in plasma","timeFrame":"Up to 190 Days"},{"measure":"Extent of urinary excretion of combined ALN-F1202 and metabolites","timeFrame":"Within 24 hours of treatment"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Key Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
