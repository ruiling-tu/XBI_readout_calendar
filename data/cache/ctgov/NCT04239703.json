Patients with kidney transplants are routinely tested (creatinine, urine protein, histology and donor specific antibody (DSA) as standard of care to detect rejection, but these tests are not adequate. Rejection is often missed by these tests (false negatives) and other processes such as acute kidney injury can produce false-positive results. Moreover, histology has a high interobserver disagreement diagnosing rejection, and cannot accurately assess acute injury. A definitive molecular assessment of rejection and injury in kidney biopsies has emerged - the Molecular Microscope® Diagnostic System (MMDx) - developed by the Alberta Transplant Applied Genomics Centre, University of Alberta. Now a new screening test is being introduced: the monitoring of donor-derived cell-free DNA (DD-cfDNA) released in the blood by the kidney during rejection. The Natera Inc DD-cfDNA Prospera® test is based on the massively multiplex PCR that targets 13,392 single nucleotide polymorphisms and targeted sequences are quantified by Next Generation Sequencing. The Prospera® test done on kidney transplant recipients detected \"active rejection\" and differentiated it from borderline rejection and no rejection. It is likely, however, that DD-cfDNA test may miss some T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR) cases and the distinction between early and fully developed antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) was not tested. No study has actually examined the DD-cfDNA results in kidney transplants with acute or chronic kidney disease (AKI and CKD). DD-cfDNA measurements have only been correlated with histology, a flawed standard. DD-cf-DNA test must now be calibrated against MMDx that is based on global gene expression, the new standard for biopsy interpretation. The present study will calibrate centrally measured (Natera Inc) DD-cfDNA levels obtained at the time of an indication biopsy against the MMDx measurements of TCMR, and ABMR (early-stage, fully-developed, and late-stage), AK, and atrophy-fibrosis. We will compare blood DD-cfDNA measurements in 600 samples at the time of 300 indication biopsies to the MMDx results, as well as central assessment of HLA antibody (One Lambda) in 300 blood samples, interpreted centrally as DSA based on the tissue typing results. This study is an extension of the INTERCOMEX ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01299168. We have collected 1203 kidney biopsies and 2422 corresponding blood samples. We extend this study to the total of 1400 biopsies and 2800 blood samples."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Kidney Transplant Rejection"],"keywords":["donor derived cell-free DNA","blood","kidney biopsy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"RNA isolated from kidney biopsies"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Kidney transplant biopsies for cause","description":"The study population includes patients with a functioning kidney transplant undergoing a biopsy for clinical indications as standard of care.","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: MMDx","Diagnostic Test: Prospera","Diagnostic Test: HLA antibody"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"MMDx","description":"Portion of kidney transplant indication biopsy","armGroupLabels":["Kidney transplant biopsies for cause"]},{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Prospera","description":"Transplant patient blood sample","armGroupLabels":["Kidney transplant biopsies for cause"],"otherNames":["transplant patient blood sample"]},{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"HLA antibody","description":"Transplant patient blood sample","armGroupLabels":["Kidney transplant biopsies for cause"],"otherNames":["transplant patient blood sample"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Calibration of Prospera test for T cell-mediated rejection","description":"Calibration of DD-cfDNA test cut-off values against the probability of T cell-mediated rejection in the biopsy as reported by MMDx.","timeFrame":"18 months"},{"measure":"Calibration of Prospera test for antibody-mediated rejection","description":"Calibration of DD-cfDNA test cut-off values against the probability of antibody-mediated rejection in the biopsy as reported by MMDx.","timeFrame":"18 months"},{"measure":"Calibration of Prospera test for kidney injury","description":"Calibration of DD-cfDNA test cut-off values against the probability of acute and chronic kidney injury in the biopsy as reported by MMDx.","timeFrame":"18 months"},{"measure":"Report calibrated Prospera test results for rejection","description":"Report new DD-cfDNA test cut-off values for rejection","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Report calibrated Prospera test results for kidney injury","description":"Report new DD-cfDNA test cut-off values for acute and chronic kidney injury","timeFrame":"6 month"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Determine if Prospera blood test can replace kidney biopsy test","description":"Determine if Prospera test, as calibrated by this DD-cfDNA-HLA-MMDx study, will avoid need for indication biopsy when kidney transplant function deteriorates.
