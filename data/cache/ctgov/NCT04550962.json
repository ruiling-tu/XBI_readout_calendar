study is to characterize patients initiating DUPIXENT for asthma in a real-world setting, with respect to their medical history, including asthma history and asthma treatment history, socio-demographic, biomarkers (including Fractional exhaled nitric oxide \\[FeNO\\]), and concomitant treatments for asthma.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\nThe secondary objectives of the study are:\n\n* To characterize real-world use patterns of DUPIXENT for asthma (eg, most commonly used regimens, reason for initiation of new asthma treatments, concomitant therapies, treatment durations, and reasons for discontinuation and/or switching)\n* To assess the effectiveness of DUPIXENT in asthma patients in a real world setting (lung function improvement, exacerbation rate, asthma control)\n* To assess comorbid type 2 conditions (atopic/allergic) and patterns of use and effects of treatment in comorbid conditions in asthma patients treated with Dupixent\n* To collect data on HealthCare Resource Utilization (HCRU)\n* To collect safety data on study participants in the real-world setting.","detailedDescription":"Each patient will be followed for up to 36
