Mixed SCLC and squamous NSCLC histology is not permitted.\n  * Previously treated in the unresectable locally advanced or metastatic setting with a platinum-containing chemotherapy and PD-(L)-1inhibitor.\n* Must have at least 1 measurable lesion per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidance (Version 1.1) (Section 1.1). The measurable lesion must be outside of a radiation field if the participant received prior radiation unless discussed and approved by the study physician.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0 or 1.\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Use of any live vaccines against infectious diseases (eg, influenza, varicella) within 4 weeks (28 days) of initiation of investigational product.\n* Underlying medical conditions or adverse events that, in the physician or sponsor's opinion, will make the administration of investigational products hazardous.\n* Prolonged QT interval defined as mean corrected QT interval (QTc) ≥ 450 milliseconds (ms).\n* Any active or documented history of autoimmune disease, including but not limited to inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, Wegner syndrome, Hashimoto syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, sarcoidosis, or autoimmune hepatitis, within 3 years of the first dose of study treatment.\n* Treatment with systemic immunosuppressive medication (including but not limited to corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and antitumor necrosis factor-α agents) administered within 2 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, or anticipation of need for systemic immunosuppressant medication during study treatment.\n\nNote: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Medical Director","affiliation":"Arcus Biosciences","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Sarah Cannon Research Institute","city":"Denver","state":"Colorado","zip":"80218","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":39.73915,"lon":-104.9847}},{"facility":"Georgetown","city":"Washington D.C.","state":"District of Columbia","zip":"20007","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":38.89511,"lon":-77.03637}},{"facility":"Emory University","city":"Atlanta","state":"Georgia","zip":"30322","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":33.749,"lon":-84.38798}},{"facility":"START Midwest","city":"Grand Rapids","state":"Michigan","zip":"49546","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":42.96336,"lon":-85.66809}},{"facility":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai/ The Tisch Cancer Center","city":"New York","state":"New York","zip":"10128","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":40.71427,"lon":-74.00597}},{"facility":"University Of Pennsylvania, Abramson Cancer Center","city":"Philadelphia","state":"Pennsylvania","zip":"19104","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":39.95238,"lon":-75.16362}},{"facility":"Mary Crowley","city":"Dallas","state":"Texas","zip":"75230","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":32.78306,"lon":-96.80667}},{"facility":"START -
