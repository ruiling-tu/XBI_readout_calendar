Participants will be randomized 3:1 in a blinded manner to receive 80 mg resmetirom or matching placebo given orally once daily in the morning for the duration of the study (until the required number of Composite Clinical Outcome events are achieved). Composite Clinical Outcome events are defined as any of the following: liver-related and CV mortality, liver transplant, and significant hepatic events, including potential hepatic decompensation events (ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, or gastroesophageal variceal hemorrhage), and confirmed increase of Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score from \\<12 to ≥15.
