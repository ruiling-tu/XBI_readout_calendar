During the second intervention period subjects will receive the alternative IP for an additional 12 weeks. IP will be administered in the home setting by a healthcare provider. The Investigator (or designee) will contact subjects (or their parent/legal guardian) to assess for any adverse events or changes in medications, treatments, or procedures. Subjects (or their parent/legal guardian) will complete weekly symptom diaries and monthly questionnaires to document corneal abrasion symptoms and frequency and gauge overall subject (or parent/legal guardian) impressions of disease severity and disease/symptom changes during the study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa","DEB - Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa","Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa","Dominant Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa"],"keywords":["Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa","DEB","Corneal Abrasions"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":16,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"KB803","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"KB803","interventionNames":["Biological: KB803"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Vehicle","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"KB803","description":"Ophthalmic suspension of replication-defective, non-integrating herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) expressing the human collagen VII protein","armGroupLabels":["KB803"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"Vehicle","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"To evaluate the safety and tolerability of KB803.","description":"Number of subjects with treatment related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.","timeFrame":"24 weeks"},{"measure":"To evaluate the effect of ophthalmic KB803 versus placebo on frequency of corneal. abrasion symptoms.","description":"Change from baseline in average number of days per month with corneal abrasion symptoms.","timeFrame":"24 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"To evaluate the effect of ophthalmic KB803 versus placebo on eye pain.","description":"Change from baseline in average weekly eye pain score.\n\nPain will be measured using a numerical scale with 0 being no hurt through 10 being the worst hurt.","timeFrame":"24 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.

KB707 is administered via nebulization, delivering the therapy directly through the airways to the lungs of subjects with advanced solid tumor malignancies.\n\nThis is a Phase 1/2, open-label, multicenter, dose escalation and expansion study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy, and immunologic effect of KB707.\n\nMonotherapy KB707 dose escalation and expansion cohorts enrolled adults with advanced solid tumor malignancies affecting the lungs who had progressed on standard of care therapy, cannot tolerate standard of care therapy, or refused standard of care therapy. The dose escalation phase (Cohorts 1 and 2) evaluated KB707 monotherapy using a standard 3+3 design, followed by a dose expansion phase (Cohort 4) to further evaluate the selected dose. Subjects received inhaled KB707 weekly for three weeks, then every three weeks. The dose escalation portion of the study is now complete, and the selected dose is being evaluated in the expansion phase.\n\nCombination regimens with a selected (fixed) dose of KB707 are being evaluated in subjects with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Subjects in Cohorts 5 and 6 are receiving inhaled KB707 once every 2 weeks (q2w), delivered in combination with Keytruda once every 6 weeks. Subjects in Cohort 7 are receiving inhaled KB707 in combination with docetaxel once every 3 weeks.\n\nAll subjects will be treated until tumor progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, symptomatic deterioration, achievement of maximal response, subject choice, Investigator decision to discontinue treatment, or the Sponsor determines to terminate the study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Lung Cancer, Non-small Cell","Lung Cancer Metastatic","Solid Tumor, Adult","Advanced Cancer","Lung Cancer (NSCLC)"],"keywords":["cancer","Krystal Biotech","lung cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":250,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cohorts 1 through 4","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Dose escalation and expansion cohorts: KB707 monotherapy in subjects with solid tumor malignancies affecting the lungs.","interventionNames":["Biological: KB707"]},{"label":"Cohort 5","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Dose expansion cohort: KB707 administered in combination with Keytruda in approximately 60 subjects with NSCLC.","interventionNames":["Biological: KB707","Drug: Pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®)"]},{"label":"Cohort 6","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Dose expansion cohort: KB707 administered in combination with Keytruda and chemotherapy in approximately 60 subjects with NSCLC.","interventionNames":["Biological: KB707","Drug: Pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®)","Drug: Chemotherapy"]},{"label":"Experimental: Cohort 7","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Dose expansion cohort: KB707 administered in combination with docetaxel in approximately 50 subjects with NSCLC.","interventionNames":["Biological: KB707","Drug: Docetaxel"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"KB707","description":"Genetically modified herpes simplex type 1 virus","armGroupLabels":["Cohort 5","Cohort 6","Cohorts 1 through 4","Experimental: Cohort 7"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®)","description":"PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor","armGroupLabels":["Cohort 5","Cohort 6"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Chemotherapy","description":"SOC chemotherapy","armGroupLabels":["Cohort 6"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Docetaxel","description":"SOC chemotherapy","armGroupLabels":["Experimental: Cohort 7"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"To evaluate the safety and tolerability of inhaled KB707 based upon assessment of adverse events (AE)","description":"Percentage of subjects with treatment-related AEs as assessed by NCI-CTCAE v5","timeFrame":"up to 36 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"To evaluate whether the proposed dose ranges include the maximum tolerated dose of KB707 as determined by incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs)","description":"Incidence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) by dose cohorts","timeFrame":"up to 36 months"},{"measure":"To evaluate the preliminary efficacy of inhaled KB707 as determined by overall response rate (ORR)","description":"Percentage of ORR for all participants","timeFrame":"up to 36 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Key Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age 18 years or older at the time of informed consent\n* Life expectancy \\>12 weeks\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1\n* Have at least one measurable lung lesion per RECIST v1.1 at Screening\n* Cohorts 1 through 4 only: Histologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced solid tumor malignancy affecting the lungs and the individual has progressed on standard of care therapy, cannot tolerate standard of care therapy, refused standard of care therapy, or has no standard of care therapy.\n* Cohorts 5, 6, and 7 only: (1) Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of stage 3 or 4 NSCLC, as per American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system (8th edition) and (2) Subject must meet the following criteria of prior lines of therapy:\n\n  1.
