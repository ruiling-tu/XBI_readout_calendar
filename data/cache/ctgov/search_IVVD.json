VYD2311 is a monoclonal antibody that attaches to the virus that causes COVID-19 and helps block it from entering your cells. It is being tested in adults and adolescents at least 12 years old. Participants in this study will be given a \"study drug\" that will be either VYD2311 or placebo.\n\nThe study drug will be given as a shot into the muscle in the participant's upper thigh or upper arm once a month with a total of 3 shots during the study.\n\nThis study will help researchers see how well VYD2311 works to prevent COVID-19 during the 90 days after the first shot. The study will also look at the safety and tolerability of VYD2311, how the study drug is processed by the body (pharmacokinetics), how the immune system reacts to the study drug (immunogenicity), and how well VYD2311 can block the virus from infecting cells (neutralization). To do these tests, your blood will be drawn at certain times during the study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["COVID-19"],"keywords":["COVID","COVID-19","mAb","antibody","COVID-19 prevention","VYD2311","SARS-CoV-2 Monocloncal Antibody"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1770,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"VYD2311-SD (single dose)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"VYD2311 administered via IM injection on Day 1, followed by placebo injection (0.9% sodium chloride \\[normal saline\\]) on Day 30 and Day 60","interventionNames":["Drug: VYD2311-SD"]},{"label":"VYD2311-MD (multidose)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"VYD2311 administered via IM injection on Day 1, Day 30, and Day 60","interventionNames":["Drug: VYD2311-MD"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Normal saline administered by IM injection on Day 1, Day 30, and Day 60","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"VYD2311-SD","description":"VYD2311-SD (single-dose arm): Intramuscular injection dosing on Day 1 with VYD2311 and Intramuscular injection dosing Placebo (normal saline) on Day 30 and Day 60","armGroupLabels":["VYD2311-SD (single dose)"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"VYD2311-MD","description":"VYD2311-MD (multi-dose): Intramuscular injection dosing on Day 1, Day 30, and Day 60 with VYD2311","armGroupLabels":["VYD2311-MD (multidose)"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"Intramuscular injection dosing on Day 1, Day 30, and Day 60 with Placebo (Normal Saline)","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"RT-PCR-confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 through Day 90","timeFrame":"90 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Assessment of safety based on treatment-emergent adverse events, injection site reactions, and hypersensitivity reactions through Day 90","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Serum concentrations of VYD2311 through Day 90","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Incidence of ADAs against VYD2311 through Day 90","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Calculated sVNA titers (VYD2311 serum concentration/variant IC50) against relevant SARS-CoV-2 variants through Day 90","timeFrame":"90 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nParticipants are eligible to be included in the study only if all the following criteria apply:\n\n1.
