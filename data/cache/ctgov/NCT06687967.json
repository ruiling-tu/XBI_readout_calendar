A minimum of 4 daily scores out of the 7 days is required to calculate the baseline average score. For participants who do not have at least 4 daily scores reported during the 7 days immediately preceding the planned randomization date, randomization can be postponed until this requirement is met, but without exceeding the 28-day maximum duration of the screening period.\n* History of failing a 2-week course of medium-to-superpotent topical corticosteroid (TCS) +/- topical calcineurin inhibitor (TCI) for the treatment of LSC within the last 6 months, unless TCS/TCI are medically not advisable. Patients with documented systemic treatment for LSC (other than antihistamines) in the past 6 months are also considered as inadequate responders to topical treatments and are potentially eligible for treatment with dupilumab after appropriate washout.\n* Appropriate contraceptive measures\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nParticipants are excluded from the study if any of the following criteria apply (at screening and baseline unless otherwise specified):\n\n* Participants diagnosed with active lesions of prurigo nodularis (broadly distributed nodules) or active lesions of atopic dermatitis (AD) within 6 months, contact dermatitis, psoriasis, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) XE \"CTCL\" \\\\f Abbreviation \\\\t \"cutaneous T-cell lymphoma\" (or suspected of CTCL), vulvar lichen planus, or vulvar lichen sclerosus.\n* Presence of skin morbidities other than LSC that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may interfere with the assessment of the study outcomes. For example: scabies, insect bite, folliculitis, lymphomatoid papulosis, chronic actinic dermatitis, dermatitis herpetiformis, sporotrichosis, bullous disease, lichen planus hypertrophicus.\n* Severe concomitant illness(es) that, in the Investigator's judgment, would adversely affect the participant's participation in the study.\n* Severe psychiatric disease that, in the Investigator's judgement, would affect the study intervention evaluation.\n* Having received or planning to use any of the treatments within the timeframe as specified in the protocol.\n\nThe above information is not intended
