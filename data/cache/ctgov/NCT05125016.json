Some participants may receive additional investigational drugs in combination with REGN4336. These additional drugs include REGN5678, cemiplimab and sarilumab.\n\nThe main purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability (how the body reacts to the drug) and effectiveness of REGN4336 alone, in combination with cemiplimab, or in combination with REGN5678. REGN4336, cemiplimab and REGN5678 are a type of treatment for cancer called immunotherapy,and are intended to activate T-cells to attack cancer cells.\n\nThis study has 2 parts. The purpose of Part 1 is to determine a safe dose of REGN4336 when given alone or when given in combination with cemiplimab or REGN5678. The purpose of Part 2 is to use the REGN4336 dose(s) determined in Part 1 to further test how well REGN4336 works to shrink tumors either when given alone or in combination with cemiplimab or REGN5678.\n\nThis study is looking at several other research questions, including:\n\n* What side effects may happen from taking REGN4336 alone, in combination with cemiplimab, or in combination with REGN5678?\n* How much REGN4336 is in the blood at different times when it is given alone, in combination with cemiplimab, or in combination with REGN5678?\n* Does the body make antibodies against the study drugs (REGN4336, cemiplimab, or REGN5678)?"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer"],"keywords":["Treatment-experienced metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC)"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"The study contains 3 separate modules in parallel: monotherapy with REGN4336 (Module 1) and combination therapies: REGN4336 plus cemiplimab (Module 2) and REGN4336 plus REGN5678 (Module 3).
