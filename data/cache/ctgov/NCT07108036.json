Participants with partners that are women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) are strongly advised to inform their partners and must agree to use effective contraception from study entry (defined as INT1) through 7 months after the last dose of study intervention. Effective methods of contraception are described in Appendix 2. Participants with pregnant partners must agree to use condoms during vaginal intercourse from study entry (defined as INT1) through 14 days after the last dose of study intervention administration. Participants assigned male sex at birth must agree to refrain from sperm donation from study entry through 14 days after the last dose of study intervention administration.\n* For female participants,\n\n  a.
