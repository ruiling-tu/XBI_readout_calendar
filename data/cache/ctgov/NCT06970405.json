The study is focused on otherwise healthy participants with obesity.\n\nThe aim of the study is to see how safe and tolerable the study drug is.\n\nThe study is looking at several other research questions, including:\n\n* How much study drug is in the blood at different times\n* What effect the study drug has on the blood clotting\n* What effect the study drug has on hormone levels\n* What effect the study drug has on some organs that produce hormones\n* What effect hormones have on the side effects produced by the study drug\n* Whether the body makes antibodies against the study drug (which could change how well the drug works or could lead to side effects)"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Obesity"],"keywords":["Healthy","Postmenopausal"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"High
