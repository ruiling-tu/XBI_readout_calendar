KB707 is administered via nebulization, delivering the therapy directly through the airways to the lungs of subjects with advanced solid tumor malignancies.\n\nThis is a Phase 1/2, open-label, multicenter, dose escalation and expansion study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy, and immunologic effect of KB707.\n\nMonotherapy KB707 dose escalation and expansion cohorts enrolled adults with advanced solid tumor malignancies affecting the lungs who had progressed on standard of care therapy, cannot tolerate standard of care therapy, or refused standard of care therapy. The dose escalation phase (Cohorts 1 and 2) evaluated KB707 monotherapy using a standard 3+3 design, followed by a dose expansion phase (Cohort 4) to further evaluate the selected dose. Subjects received inhaled KB707 weekly for three weeks, then every three weeks. The dose escalation portion of the study is now complete, and the selected dose is being evaluated in the expansion phase.\n\nCombination regimens with a selected (fixed) dose of KB707 are being evaluated in subjects with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Subjects in Cohorts 5 and 6 are receiving inhaled KB707 once every 2 weeks (q2w), delivered in combination with Keytruda once every 6 weeks. Subjects in Cohort 7 are receiving inhaled KB707 in combination with docetaxel once every 3 weeks.\n\nAll subjects will be treated until tumor progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, symptomatic deterioration, achievement of maximal response, subject choice, Investigator decision to discontinue treatment, or the Sponsor determines to terminate the study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Lung Cancer, Non-small Cell","Lung Cancer Metastatic","Solid Tumor, Adult","Advanced Cancer","Lung Cancer (NSCLC)"],"keywords":["cancer","Krystal Biotech","lung cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":250,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cohorts 1 through 4","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Dose escalation and expansion cohorts: KB707 monotherapy in subjects with solid tumor malignancies affecting the lungs.","interventionNames":["Biological: KB707"]},{"label":"Cohort 5","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Dose expansion cohort: KB707 administered in combination with Keytruda in approximately 60 subjects with NSCLC.","interventionNames":["Biological: KB707","Drug: Pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®)"]},{"label":"Cohort 6","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Dose expansion cohort: KB707 administered in combination with Keytruda and chemotherapy in approximately 60 subjects with NSCLC.","interventionNames":["Biological: KB707","Drug: Pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®)","Drug: Chemotherapy"]},{"label":"Experimental: Cohort 7","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Dose expansion cohort: KB707 administered in combination with docetaxel in approximately 50 subjects with NSCLC.","interventionNames":["Biological: KB707","Drug: Docetaxel"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"KB707","description":"Genetically modified herpes simplex type 1 virus","armGroupLabels":["Cohort 5","Cohort 6","Cohorts 1 through 4","Experimental: Cohort 7"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®)","description":"PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor","armGroupLabels":["Cohort 5","Cohort 6"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Chemotherapy","description":"SOC chemotherapy","armGroupLabels":["Cohort 6"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Docetaxel","description":"SOC chemotherapy","armGroupLabels":["Experimental: Cohort 7"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"To evaluate the safety and tolerability of inhaled KB707 based upon assessment of adverse events (AE)","description":"Percentage of subjects with treatment-related AEs as assessed by NCI-CTCAE v5","timeFrame":"up to 36 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"To evaluate whether the proposed dose ranges include the maximum tolerated dose of KB707 as determined by incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs)","description":"Incidence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) by dose cohorts","timeFrame":"up to 36 months"},{"measure":"To evaluate the preliminary efficacy of inhaled KB707 as determined by overall response rate (ORR)","description":"Percentage of ORR for all participants","timeFrame":"up to 36 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Key Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age 18 years or older at the time of informed consent\n* Life expectancy \\>12 weeks\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1\n* Have at least one measurable lung lesion per RECIST v1.1 at Screening\n* Cohorts 1 through 4 only: Histologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced solid tumor malignancy affecting the lungs and the individual has progressed on standard of care therapy, cannot tolerate standard of care therapy, refused standard of care therapy, or has no standard of care therapy.\n* Cohorts 5, 6, and 7 only: (1) Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of stage 3 or 4 NSCLC, as per American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system (8th edition) and (2) Subject must meet the following criteria of prior lines of therapy:\n\n  1.
