is to determine whether vonsetamig will safely decrease anti-HLA antibodies to allow for kidney transplantation.\n\nVonsetamig is being studied for treatment of patients in need of kidney transplantation who are highly sensitized to HLA.\n\nThe study is looking at several other research questions, including:\n\n* Side effects that may be experienced from taking vonsetamig\n* How vonsetamig works in the body\n* How much vonsetamig is present in the blood\n* If vonsetamig works to lower levels of antibodies to HLA"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Kidney Disease
