However, there is currently no adequate method to determine which patients should receive these adjuvant therapies. Identifying those with a good prognosis without adjuvant therapy could reduce the risk of adverse events, lessen the burden of clinic visits, and reduce healthcare costs.\n\nAmong various approaches, ctDNA-based MRD (minimal residual disease) analysis is highly anticipated and has already been introduced into clinical practice for hematologic malignancies. However, solid tumors' development as a companion diagnostic has been limited, and regulatory approval is mainly being considered based on performance evaluation data. In this study, we will conduct a performance evaluation of MRD analysis using Signatera™ in patients with stage I-III NSCLC while also collecting other prognostic factors based on clinicopathological information and survival data."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["NSCLC, Stage I, II, III"],"keywords":["Signatera™","minimal residual disease","MRD","lung cancer","NSCLC"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"18 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Blood samples collected in Streck tubes and EDTA tubes Tissue samples prepared on FFPE slides"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":350,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Neoadjuvant therapy group","description":"Resectable preoperative clinical stage II-III disease (with planned neoadjuvant therapy)"},{"label":"Adjuvant therapy group","description":"Resectable preoperative clinical stage IB-III disease (with no planned neoadjuvant therapy)"},{"label":"Surgery-alone group","description":"Resectable preoperative clinical stage IB-III disease (with no planned neoadjuvant therapy)"},{"label":"Chemoradiotherapy group","description":"Unresectable clinical stage III disease"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"2-year PFS","timeFrame":"Analyses are planned to be performed 4.5 years after the start of the study."}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. A histopathologically confirmed diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)\n\n   The diagnosis (by cytology or biopsy) must be one of the following: \"adenocarcinoma,\" \"squamous cell carcinoma,\" \"non-small cell carcinoma consistent with adenocarcinoma,\" \"non-small cell carcinoma consistent with squamous cell carcinoma,\" or \"non-small cell carcinoma not otherwise specified (NOS).\" If the histological subtype differs between cytology and biopsy specimens, the subtype determined by the biopsy specimen shall be used.\n\n   At the time of enrollment, diagnoses of \"squamous cell carcinoma\" or \"non-small cell carcinoma consistent with squamous cell carcinoma\" are classified as squamous cell carcinoma, whereas \"adenocarcinoma,\" \"non-small cell carcinoma consistent with adenocarcinoma,\" and \"non-small cell carcinoma NOS\" are classified as non-squamous cell carcinoma.\n2. Meets one of the following criteria (1-3):\n\n1\\. Stage IB-III (preoperative clinical stage) deemed resectable, with no planned neoadjuvant therapy.\n\n2\\. Stage III disease deemed amenable to curative-intent chemoradiotherapy. 3. Stage II-III (preoperative clinical stage) deemed resectable, with planned neoadjuvant therapy.\n\n3\\) Age ≥ 18 years at the time of enrollment. 4) The attending physician has determined that tissue and blood samples can be provided.\n\n5\\) Written informed consent has been obtained from the patient.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Presence of active multiple primary malignancies (defined as synchronous multiple cancers/tumors or metachronous multiple cancers/tumors with a disease-free interval of 3 years or less).
