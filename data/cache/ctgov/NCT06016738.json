The purpose of this trial is to compare the safety and efficacy of palazestrant (OP-1250) as a single agent to the standard of care endocrine therapy: either fulvestrant or an aromatase inhibitor (anastrozole, letrozole, or exemestane).\n\nThis trial is seeking adult participants with ER+, HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer whose disease has relapsed or progressed on 1 or 2 prior lines of standard-of-care endocrine therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Prior lines of therapy must include one line of endocrine therapy in combination with a CDK 4/6 inhibitor. In the dose-selection part of the trial, approximately 120 participants will be randomized to one of the two doses of palazestrant or to the standard-of-care endocrine therapy. Thereafter, approximately 390 participants will be randomized to palazestrant at the selected dose or to the standard-of-care endocrine therapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Breast Cancer","Advanced Breast Cancer","Metastatic Breast Cancer","ER Positive Breast Cancer","HER2 Negative Breast Carcinoma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":510,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Palazestrant (OP-1250)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive Palazestrant","interventionNames":["Drug: Palazestrant"]},{"label":"Standard of Care Endocrine Therapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will receive Investigator's choice of one of the Standard of Care drugs (fulvestrant, anastrozole, letrozole, or exemestane)","interventionNames":["Drug: Fulvestrant","Drug: Anastrozole","Drug: Letrozole","Drug: Exemestane"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Palazestrant","description":"Participants will be treated with palazestrant once daily on a 4 week (28 day) cycle.
