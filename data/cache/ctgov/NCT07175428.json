The study is focused on participants who have atrial fibrillation, which means that the heart beats too fast and unevenly. REGN7508 and REGN9933 are designed to help stop blood clots forming in patients with atrial fibrillation.\n\nThe aim of the study is to see how well REGN7508 and REGN9933 work in patients that get medicine for their atrial fibrillation. The bleeding effects of REGN7508 and REGN9933 will be compared to another medicine (apixaban), which is available on the market to treat and prevent formation of blood clots.\n\nThe study is looking at several other research questions, including:\n\n* What side effects may happen from taking REGN7508 or REGN9933\n* How well do the study drugs reduce the risk of having a stroke\n* How much of REGN7508 or REGN9933 is in the blood at different times\n* Whether the body makes antibodies against REGN7508 or REGN9933 (which could make the drugs less effective or could lead to side effects)"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation (AF)"],"keywords":["Bleeding","Stroke","Systemic embolism","Blood clots"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"REGN7508","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: REGN7508"]},{"label":"REGN9933","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: REGN9933"]},{"label":"Apixaban","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug: Apixaban"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"REGN7508","description":"Administered per the protocol","armGroupLabels":["REGN7508"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"REGN9933","description":"Administered per the protocol","armGroupLabels":["REGN9933"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Apixaban","description":"Administered per the protocol","armGroupLabels":["Apixaban"],"otherNames":["Eliquis"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Incidence of any bleeding","description":"Defined as the composite of International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) major bleeding, ISTH Clinically Relevant Non-Major (CRNM) bleeding, or minor bleeding","timeFrame":"12 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Incidence of the composite of ISTH major bleeding or ISTH CRNM bleeding","timeFrame":"12 weeks"},{"measure":"Incidence of ISTH major bleeding","timeFrame":"12 weeks"},{"measure":"Incidence of ISTH CRNM bleeding","timeFrame":"12 weeks"},{"measure":"Incidence of minor bleeding","timeFrame":"12 weeks"},{"measure":"Number of ISTH major bleeding events","timeFrame":"12 weeks"},{"measure":"Number of ISTH CRNM bleeding events","timeFrame":"12 weeks"},{"measure":"Number of minor bleeding events","timeFrame":"12 weeks"},{"measure":"Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)","timeFrame":"Approximately 25 weeks"},{"measure":"Severity of TEAEs","timeFrame":"Approximately 25 weeks"},{"measure":"Incidence of the composite of stroke or systemic embolism","timeFrame":"Approximately 12 weeks"},{"measure":"Incidence of Antidrug Antibodies (ADA) to REGN7508","timeFrame":"12 weeks"},{"measure":"Magnitude of ADA to REGN7508","timeFrame":"12 weeks"},{"measure":"Incidence of ADA to REGN9933","timeFrame":"12 weeks"},{"measure":"Magnitude of ADA to REGN9933","timeFrame":"12 weeks"},{"measure":"Concentrations of REGN7508","timeFrame":"Approximately 25 weeks"},{"measure":"Concentrations of REGN9933","timeFrame":"Approximately 25 weeks"},{"measure":"Change from baseline in activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT)","timeFrame":"Approximately 25 weeks"},{"measure":"Change from baseline in Prothrombin Time (PT)","timeFrame":"Approximately 25 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Key Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
