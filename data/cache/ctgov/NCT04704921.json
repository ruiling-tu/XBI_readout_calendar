Wet AMD is characterized by loss of vision due to new, leaky blood vessel formation in the retina. Wet AMD is a significant cause of vision loss in the United States, Europe and Japan, with up to 2 million people living with wet AMD in these geographies alone. Current anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapies have significantly changed the landscape for treatment of wet AMD, becoming the standard of care due to their ability to maintain or prevent progression of vision loss in the majority of patients. These therapies, however, require life-long intraocular injections, typically repeated every 4 to 16 weeks in frequency, to maintain efficacy. Due to the burden of these treatments, patients often experience a decline in vision with reduced frequency of treatment over time.","detailedDescription":"This randomized, partially masked, active-controlled, Phase 2b/3 clinical study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of ABBV-RGX-314 gene therapy in participants with nAMD. The study will evaluate 2 dose levels of ABBV-RGX-314 relative to an active comparator. The primary endpoint of this study is the mean change from baseline in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of ABBV-RGX-314 relative to ranibizumab at Week 54. Approximately 630 participants who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria, will be enrolled into one of 3 arms.\n\nA bilateral treatment substudy conducted at US sites is an open-label, partially randomized, parallel arm study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of subretinal ABBV-RGX-314 administered bilaterally in participants who have bilateral nAMD. Previously treated crossover participants from the control arm of the main study who crossed over and received ABBV-RGX-314 in the study eye will receive the same ABBV-RGX-314 dose in the contralateral eye (ie, same dose as in the study eye), and newcomers (participants who have not been randomized in an ABBV-RGX-314 study) and untreated crossover participants (ongoing control participants in the main study who have completed Week 54 but have not crossed over to receive ABBV-RGX-314 in the main study) will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive ABBV-RGX-314 Dose 1 or ABBV-RGX-314 Dose 2 in both eyes. Up to 15 participants who qualify for the substudy will be enrolled and followed for a minimum of 50 weeks."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["AMD","nAMD","Wet Age-related Macular Degeneration","wAMD","Wet AMD","CNV","Neovascular AMD","Neovascular Age-related Macular Degeneration","Choroidal Neovascularization"],"keywords":["Age-Related Macular Degeneration","Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration","Macular Degeneration","Wet Macular Degeneration","Choroidal Neovascularization","Retinal Degeneration","Retinal Diseases","Eye Diseases","Ranibizumab","Angiogenesis Inhibitors","Angiogenesis Modulating Agents","Growth Substances","Physiological Effects of Drugs","Growth Inhibitors","Antineoplastic Agents","Gene therapy","Anti-vascular endothelial grown factory therapy","Anti-VEGF therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"2 ABBV-RGX-314 treatment arms, 1 control arm (ranibizumab)","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","maskingDescription":"The administration of ABBV-RGX-314 requires an outpatient surgical procedure performed in an operating room, while the active control, ranibizumab, is administered via intravitreal injection in an office setting.
