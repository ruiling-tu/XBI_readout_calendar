Part A is a dose escalation study in participants with any advanced solid tumor with FGFR/FGF pathway alterations who have exhausted approved standard therapies. Part A will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of TYRA-200 to determine the optimal and maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Part B will evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of TYRA-200 in participants with unresectable locally advanced/metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma who have previously received an FGFR inhibitor and have FGFR2 kinase-domain mutations resistant to other FGFR inhibitors."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Locally Advanced Cholangiocarcinoma","Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma","Solid Tumor","Metastatic Cholangiocarcinoma"],"keywords":["FGFR2 gene activation","FGFR2 gene alterations","FGFR2 gene fusion/rearrangement","FGFR2 gene mutation","FGFR2 gene translocation","FGFR2","Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2)","Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 alterations","locally advanced cancer","metastatic cancer","solid tumors","cholangiocarcinoma","intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma","unresectable cholangiocarcinoma","metastatic cholangiocarcinoma","fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitor"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Phase 1 Part A and Part B","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"TYRA-200 taken once daily by mouth in 28-day cycles","interventionNames":["Drug: Phase 1 Part A -
