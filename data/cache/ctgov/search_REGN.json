This is an open-label study, meaning everyone in the study will receive dupilumab.\n\nParticipants will have a screening visit where they will complete surveys and undergo an endoscopy (EGD). Blood and biopsies (small tissue samples) will also be collected. If eligible and enrolled into the study, participants will receive weekly subcutaneous (under the skin) injections of dupilumab for 52 weeks (one year). The first dose of dupilumab will be administered in the clinic at the enrollment visit (day 0) and participants (or their caregivers) will receive training on how to self-administer the remaining doses.\n\nParticipants will return for study visits every at weeks 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 44, and 52. During these visits, vital signs (temperature, heart rate, etc.) will be collected and participants will complete surveys. During visits at week 12, 24, and 52, blood will be collected and an endoscopy with biopsy will be performed.\n\nAt 64 weeks (12 weeks after the last dose of dupilumab), participants assigned female at birth (AFAB) may be asked to come to the clinic for a urine pregnancy test.","detailedDescription":"This research study aims to learn how well an FDA-approved drug called dupilumab works in treating patients with Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) and severe strictures (esophageal narrowing).\n\nThis is an open-label study, which means everyone enrolled will receive dupilumab. Dupilumab is a weekly injection, administered using a needle under the skin (subcutaneous injection). Dupilumab is already approved by the FDA for treating EoE.\n\nParticipants will be part of the study for approximately 52-64 weeks. In-person study visits will occur at specific intervals. Study Visits will happen at the beginning of the study (screening), day 0 (enrollment), and weeks 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 44, and 52 post-enrollment.\n\nUpper Endoscopies are performed at screening and weeks 12, 24, and 52 (or if participation ends early).\n\nPregnancy Status Check: 12 weeks after the last dose of dupilumab, participants Assigned Female at Birth (AFAB) may return to the clinic for a urine pregnancy test.\n\nStudy Procedures: What Participants Can Expect\n\n1. Consent: Participants will review the study with the study team and have an opportunity to ask questions. If they decide to participate, they will sign a consent form.\n2. Screening Procedures: These ensure eligibility for the study and include:\n\n   * Answering questions about demographics and medical history.\n   * A physical exam (checking vital signs like temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, height, and weight).\n   * Reviewing medications.\n   * Completing surveys about EoE symptoms, feelings, and quality of life.\n   * Providing a blood sample.\n   * Completing a urine pregnancy test (if applicable).\n   * Undergoing an upper endoscopy (EGD) using a flexible, lighted tube to examine the stomach, small intestine, and esophagus. Sedation may be used during the procedure. During the EGD, tissue samples (biopsies) will be taken. If the participant has narrowing in their esophagus (a stricture) that needs to be stretched (dilated) may also be dilated during the procedure.\n3. Enrollment visit (Day 0): Once eligibility is confirmed, participants will return to clinic to receive their first dose of dupilumab. At this visit, participants will:\n\n   * Complete surveys about EoE symptoms, feelings, and quality of life\n   * Check vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, respiratory rate, heart rate, and weight).\n   * Provide a blood sample.\n   * Complete a urine pregnancy test (if applicable)\n   * Discuss lifestyle considerations that should be followed (birth control methods, medications, and diet)\n   * Review medications and any new symptoms or medical history.\n   * A health care provider will give the first dose of dupilumab and teach participants (and/or their caregivers) how to administer the medication at home.\n   * Receive dupilumab to take home and instructions for giving the medication weekly.\n4. Throughout the 1-year dosing period of the study, participants (and/or their caregivers) will continue to inject dupilumab at home each week and complete a dosing diary. Participants will come to clinic at weeks 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 44, and 52. Procedures at these visits include:\n\n   * Completing surveys about EoE symptoms, feelings, and quality of life\n   * Vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, respiratory rate, heart rate, and weight).\n   * Providing a blood sample.\n   * Completing a urine pregnancy test (if applicable)\n   * Discussing lifestyle considerations that should be followed (birth control methods, medications, and diet)\n   * Reviewing medications and any new symptoms or medical history.\n   * During week 12, 24, and 52 (or at the end of the study), there will also be an EGD with biopsies and dilation (if necessary).\n   * Returning all used and unused dupilumab to the clinic.\n   * Receive dupilumab to take home and instructions for giving the medication weekly.\n\n5.12 weeks after the last dose of dupilumab, participants Assigned Female at Birth (AFAB) participants may return for an in-person visit to complete a urine pregnancy test."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Eosinophilic Esophagitis","EoE"],"keywords":["EoE","Stricture","dupilumab","Eosinophilic Esophagitis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Open Label dupilumab","type":"OTHER","description":"Open label dupilumab 300mg injection given subcutaneously weekly, for 52 weeks.","interventionNames":["Drug: Dupilumab"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Dupilumab","description":"300mg weekly subcutaneous injection","armGroupLabels":["Open Label dupilumab"],"otherNames":["Dupilumab Pre-filled Syringe","Dupixent"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Histologic Response to Dupilumab","description":"Proportion (percentage) of patients with histologic response, defined as \\<15 eosinophils per high-power field (eos/hpf), after 24 weeks of dupilumab 300mg weekly.","timeFrame":"24 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Minimum Esophageal Caliber","description":"Change in minimum esophageal caliber (measured in millimeters (mm)) as measured using EndoFLIP (Endoluminal Functional Lumen Imaging Probe) from baseline to week 24.","timeFrame":"24 weeks"},{"measure":"Decrease in Number of Dilations","description":"Decrease in the total number of esophageal dilations (esophageal stretching) required throughout the study (which includes four endoscopies - screening, week 12, week 24, and week 52) compared to the number of dilations performed over the four endoscopies prior to study entry.","timeFrame":"52 weeks"},{"measure":"Change in Endoscopic Severity","description":"Change in endoscopic severity, measured using the EoE Endoscope Reference Score (EREFS), from baseline to week 24.

The study is focused on participants who have atrial fibrillation, which means that the heart beats too fast and unevenly. REGN7508 and REGN9933 are designed to help stop blood clots forming in patients with atrial fibrillation.\n\nThe aim of the study is to see how well REGN7508 and REGN9933 work in patients that get medicine for their atrial fibrillation. The bleeding effects of REGN7508 and REGN9933 will be compared to another medicine (apixaban), which is available on the market to treat and prevent formation of blood clots.\n\nThe study is looking at several other research questions, including:\n\n* What side effects may happen from taking REGN7508 or REGN9933\n* How well do the study drugs reduce the risk of having a stroke\n* How much of REGN7508 or REGN9933 is in the blood at different times\n* Whether the body makes antibodies against REGN7508 or REGN9933 (which could make the drugs less effective or could lead to side effects)"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation (AF)"],"keywords":["Bleeding","Stroke","Systemic embolism","Blood clots"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"REGN7508","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: REGN7508"]},{"label":"REGN9933","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: REGN9933"]},{"label":"Apixaban","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug: Apixaban"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"REGN7508","description":"Administered per the protocol","armGroupLabels":["REGN7508"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"REGN9933","description":"Administered per the protocol","armGroupLabels":["REGN9933"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Apixaban","description":"Administered per the protocol","armGroupLabels":["Apixaban"],"otherNames":["Eliquis"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Incidence of any bleeding","description":"Defined as the composite of International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) major bleeding, ISTH Clinically Relevant Non-Major (CRNM) bleeding, or minor bleeding","timeFrame":"12 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Incidence of the composite of ISTH major bleeding or ISTH CRNM bleeding","timeFrame":"12 weeks"},{"measure":"Incidence of ISTH major bleeding","timeFrame":"12 weeks"},{"measure":"Incidence of ISTH CRNM bleeding","timeFrame":"12 weeks"},{"measure":"Incidence of minor bleeding","timeFrame":"12 weeks"},{"measure":"Number of ISTH major bleeding events","timeFrame":"12 weeks"},{"measure":"Number of ISTH CRNM bleeding events","timeFrame":"12 weeks"},{"measure":"Number of minor bleeding events","timeFrame":"12 weeks"},{"measure":"Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)","timeFrame":"Approximately 25 weeks"},{"measure":"Severity of TEAEs","timeFrame":"Approximately 25 weeks"},{"measure":"Incidence of the composite of stroke or systemic embolism","timeFrame":"Approximately 12 weeks"},{"measure":"Incidence of Antidrug Antibodies (ADA) to REGN7508","timeFrame":"12 weeks"},{"measure":"Magnitude of ADA to REGN7508","timeFrame":"12 weeks"},{"measure":"Incidence of ADA to REGN9933","timeFrame":"12 weeks"},{"measure":"Magnitude of ADA to REGN9933","timeFrame":"12 weeks"},{"measure":"Concentrations of REGN7508","timeFrame":"Approximately 25 weeks"},{"measure":"Concentrations of REGN9933","timeFrame":"Approximately 25 weeks"},{"measure":"Change from baseline in activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT)","timeFrame":"Approximately 25 weeks"},{"measure":"Change from baseline in Prothrombin Time (PT)","timeFrame":"Approximately 25 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Key Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.

It brings together individuals with deep clinical and scientific expertise in allergic diseases, including epidemiology, genetics, inflammation, and tolerance mechanisms to investigate, in a coordinated strategy, the hypothesis that the IL-4Rα-R576 variant drives TH2/TH17 cell inflammation by subverting allergen-specific iTreg cells into TH17 cells. Asthmatics bearing this endotype will be particularly likely to favorably respond to Dupilumab therapy by virtue of its prevention of iTreg cell reprogramming into TH17-like cells, potentially leading to their long-term stability and potential for sustained immune tolerance."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Asthma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"This is a genotype stratified, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase IV clinical trial","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","maskingDescription":"Double blind, placebo controlled.","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":150,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treatment group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Dupilumab (Dupixent®) administered subcutaneously every two weeks.

These landmark trials (CHAARTED, STAMPEDE, LATITUDE), which used overall survival as their endpoints, required, on average, 10 years from start of trial to first peer-reviewed publication. Given the challenge of using traditional measures of response (RECIST criteria) when designing prostate cancer clinical trials, the Prostate Cancer Working group 2 (PCWG2) made trial-design recommendations. One was to separate treatment outcomes into early measures of response and later time-to-event measures of progression. The goal is to shift the trial objective to capture and reflect the actual effect of the tested treatment and, in doing so, provide a more timely drug development milieu for the metastatic patient. These early measure of response end points, such as undetectable PSA with testosterone recovery, are now being actively integrated into clinical trial design."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Prostate Cancer Metastatic"],"keywords":["Cancer","Chemoimmunotherapy","Prostate Cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":26,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"ADT Followed by Chemoimmunotherapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"REGN2810 followed by chemoimmunotherapy:\n\nInitiate degarelix 240mg SC once, followed by leuprolide acetate 22.5mg SC every 3 months.\n\nWeek 4 start cemiplimab (REGN 2810) 350mg IV every 3 weeks (flat dose) for up to 55 weeks or intolerable side effect or progression of disease.\n\nWeek 10 start docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 21 days for up to 6 cycles.","interventionNames":["Drug: REGN2810","Drug: Degarelix","Drug: Leuprolide Acetate","Drug: Docetaxel"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"REGN2810","description":"Cemiplimab (REGN 2810) is administered starting at week 4 at a dose of 350mg IV every 3 weeks (flat dose) for up to 55 weeks or intolerable side effect or progression of disease.","armGroupLabels":["ADT Followed by Chemoimmunotherapy"],"otherNames":["Cemiplimab"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Degarelix","description":"Degarelix is administered subcutaneously (SC) at a dose of 240mg once.","armGroupLabels":["ADT Followed by Chemoimmunotherapy"],"otherNames":["Firmagon"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Leuprolide Acetate","description":"Leuprolide acetate is provided at a dose of 22.5mg SC every 3 months.","armGroupLabels":["ADT Followed by Chemoimmunotherapy"],"otherNames":["Lupron"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Docetaxel","description":"Docetaxel is administered starting at week 10 at a dose of 75 mg/m2 every 21 days for up to 6 cycles.","armGroupLabels":["ADT Followed by Chemoimmunotherapy"],"otherNames":["Taxotere"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Percentage of Subjects Achieving Undetectable PSA at 6 months after Combination Treatment","description":"The percentage of subject achieving undetectable PSA levels at 6 months after the combination will use measured to determine safety and activity of combined hormonal chemoimmunotherapy.","timeFrame":"6 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Time to Development of Castrate Resistance","description":"A measurement of the time until the patient's prostate cancer has stopped responding to hormone therapy","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Radiographic Response","description":"The objective response of the target lesions as measured by the presence of tumor markers","timeFrame":"6 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.

In addition, the investigators will correlate improvements in microbial diversity/decreased staph abundance with clinical improvements as assessed via questionnaires and objective/subjective smell function and also as improvements in cellular/immune T2 inflammation as assessed by reduced expression of T2 cytokines/chemokines and eosinophil/eosinophil-derived proteins.","detailedDescription":"Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) is an important clinical problem and is associated with profound unmet medical needs given the absence - until recently - of adequate medical therapies. It has an estimated prevalence of 2-4% in the USA and Europe but also has disproportionate burden on quality of life and economic burden.\n\nCRSwNPs is predominantly (in 62-85% of patients) a type 2 (T2) disease, as demonstrated by an IL-4high, IL-5high, IL-13high cytokine signature and prominent infiltration with eosinophils, basophils, and newly recruited mast cells. Another characteristic feature of CRSwNPs is the colonization of the sinonasal space with Staphylococcus aureus (Staph). Staph comprises \\<10% of the bacterial biomass of the healthy nose but infections with this pathogen is observed in the majority of CRSwNP patients and especially in those with asthma comorbidity or AERD.\n\nEvidence exists for an upregulatory vicious circle involving type 2 inflammation promoting an immune deficient state with reduced innate immune responsiveness to staph, leading to colonization/infection with staph and then with the staph producing exotoxins and other pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that promote and exacerbate the T2high state. A central endogenous immune defense to protect against colonization and infection with staph consists of innate immune-derived anti-microbial proteins (AMPs). There are two major families of AMPs, the defensins and the cathelicidins that together comprise \\>2000 proteins. These cationic proteins provide immune defenses against a range of pathogens. Downregulation of the ß-defensins (BD)-2 and BD-3 and cathelicidin LL-37 is particularly relevant to atopic dermatitis (AD) and underlies the particular susceptibility of AD skin to colonization and infection with staph. Thus, in AD staph can comprise up to 90% of the bacterial species present on the skin. These AMPs are predominantly expressed in epithelial cells including of the skin but are also expressed by airway epithelial cells (AECs). Sinonasal AECs produce all the ß-defensins (BD1-4) and BD1-3 expression is reduced in allergic inflammatory diseases of the airway. In addition to AMPs shared with the dermis, another important AMP, S100A7 (psoriasin) is also uniquely reduced in CRS.\n\nThis diminished expression of ß-defensins and cathelicidin in AD has been ascribed to overproduction of IL-4/IL-13. Inhibition of AMP expression in upper airway allergic disease has also been ascribed to these cytokines. In addition to inhibiting its production, IL-4/IL-13 also block the mobilization of BD-3 to the surface of staph. T2 cytokines further promote staph infection in AD by enhancing binding of these pathogens to atopic skin. Finally, IL-4/IL-13 may further enhance susceptibility to infection through their adverse impact on tight junction barrier function, thereby promoting microinvasive disease and access of PAMPs to submucosal targets.\n\nThe final component of the pro-inflammatory vicious circle is the capacity of Staph-derived enterotoxins to feedback to enhance production of T2-associated cytokines, thereby further exacerbating eosinophilic inflammation and the reduced innate immune defense against pathogens. This enhancement of the T2 signature has traditionally been ascribed to the production of superantigens (and antigens) by staph that engage Th2 effector cells residing in the sinuses via their T cell receptor and stimulates their further activation and cytokine secretion. However, staph-derived PAMPs including lipoteichoic acid and staph enterotoxin B (SEB) can also induce secretion of T2-promoting cytokines such as IL-33 and TSLP by engagement of toll-like receptor (TLR)2 and other pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) on AECs.\n\nIn summary CRSwNPs frequently comprises a state in which staph-derived PAMPs exacerbate an already established T2high inflammatory condition, T2-derived cytokines but in particular IL-4 and IL-13 interact with AECs to reduce AMP production, and reduced expression of AMPs promotes the colonization and further infection with staph.\n\nThis pathogenic mechanism is now unambiguously established in atopic dermatitis. This was demonstrated via the ability of blockade of IL-4/IL-13 via administration of anti-IL-4R to decrease Staphylococcus aureus colonization and increase microbial diversity in atopic dermatitis - an effect that strongly correlated with clinical benefit. The investigators propose that a similar molecular mechanism for dupilumab will be observed in CRSwNPs."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Nasal Polyps","Staphylococcus Aureus"],"keywords":["Nasal polyps","Staph aureus","Interleukin-4/-13"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Open label, single arm","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Dupilumab treatment","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Treatment with dupilumab to demonstrate decreased staph prevalence and improve microbial diversity","interventionNames":["Drug: Dupilumab Prefilled Syringe"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Dupilumab Prefilled Syringe","description":"Dupilumab 300 mg","armGroupLabels":["Dupilumab treatment"],"otherNames":["DUPIXENT"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"To demonstrate that dupilumab reduces staphylococcus aureus","description":"To demonstrate that dupilumab reduces staphylococcus aureus (phyla firmicutes) abundance.

Another aim of the study is to see how effective marlotamig by itself, or in combination with cemiplimab (with or without chemotherapy), is at treating cancer patients.\n\nThe study is also looking at:\n\n* Side effects that may be experienced by people taking marlotamig by itself and in combination with cemiplimab with or without chemotherapy\n* How marlotamig works in the body by itself and in combination with cemiplimab with or without chemotherapy\n* How much marlotamig is present in the blood when given by itself and in combination with cemiplimab with or without chemotherapy\n* To see if marlotamig by itself and in combination with cemiplimab with or without chemotherapy works to treat cancer by controlling the proliferation of tumor cells to shrink the tumor\n* Whether the body makes antibodies against the study drugs (marlotamig and cemiplimab) (which could make the drug less effective or could lead to side effects)"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Advanced Solid

The drug works by controlling allergic inflammation of the esophagus. The esophagus is a food pipe that transfers food from the mouth into the stomach. Participants with EoE have dysfunction of the muscle of the esophagus (impaired peristalsis) that is not favorable for the transport function.\n\nMain question this study aims to answer is: Whether Dupilumab helps improve muscle activity of the esophagus in participants with EOE?\n\nParticipants will:\n\nTake Dupilumab every week for 12 weeks. Visit the clinic before and after starting the medication. Keep a diary of symptoms.","detailedDescription":"Eosinophilic esophagitis (EOE) is an allergic inflammation of the mucosa of the esophagus. One or more of the common food constituents (milk, egg, soy, wheat, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish) in a susceptible host (people with history of atopic dermatitis or asthma) is the cause of allergic inflammation in EOE. It is a Th-2 immune cell mediated allergic inflammation that leads to infiltration of the esophageal mucosa with eosinophils (\\> 15/high power field/HPF), which leads to submucosal fibrosis, esophageal stricture, narrow esophageal lumen, and reduced distensibility of the esophagus. Patients present with symptoms of dysphagia, food impaction, heartburn, and other non-descript symptoms. The condition can start in childhood and continue in adulthood; however, patients may present at any age. Current incidence estimates range from 5 to 10 cases per 100,000, and current prevalence estimates range from 0.5 to 1 case per 10001. Some of the EOE patients respond to acid inhibition therapy and it may be that acid reflux is the cause of EOE in some patients.\n\nThe inflammatory damage to the esophageal epithelium results in symptoms of esophageal dysfunction, such as dysphagia. Chronic inflammation of the esophagus may also lead to remodeling, stricture formation, and fibrosis6. The fibrotic aspect of progressed disease is not well understood, and whether or not this can be reversed with treatment is unknown. Current therapeutic approaches include chronic dietary elimination, swallowed topical formulation of corticosteroids and esophageal dilation. Emergency endoscopy for prolonged and/or painful food impaction is associated with a risk of severe esophageal injury, and it does not alter the underlying pathogenesis or progression of the disease. Although swallowed topical corticosteroids have been reported in clinical trials to induce partial clinical responses and histologic remission, they are not uniformly effective and can be associated with fungal infections as well as disease recurrence after discontinuation. Studies shows that Dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody against IL4 and IL13 is an effective treatment in patients with EOE.\n\nFew years ago, the investigators observed an additional mechanism of dysphagia in EOE patients, which relates to the esophageal motor function. The latter is best assessed by esophageal manometry study, which is normal in the majority (80%) of EOE patients. However, esophageal manometry records only the function of inner, i.e., circular muscle layer of the esophagus, which is only 50% of the total esophageal muscles mass (muscularis propria). The other 50%, i.e., longitudinal muscle is the outer of the 2 muscle layers of the esophagus. A series of studies from my laboratory reveal that the longitudinal muscle layer is responsible for the descending relaxation of the peristaltic reflex. Descending relaxation is critical because it allows esophagus to distend and bolus to proceed in aboral direction with minimal resistance to the flow of swallowed contents. The investigators found that patients with EOE have, 1) dysfunctional longitudinal muscle which manifests as a lower amplitude of contraction as compared to normal subjects and, 2) temporal discoordination between the contractions of the two muscle layers15. Both of the above scenarios can lead to impaired descending relaxation that can results in a smaller luminal CSA of the esophagus during peristalsis as compared to normal subject, which will appear as a narrow lumen esophagus on the barium swallow study, a scenario similar to an esophageal stricture, well described in patients with EOE. A narrow lumen esophagus will result in resistance to the passage of bolus or in other words difficulty swallowing (dysphagia).\n\nPatients with EOE have reduced distensibility of the esophagus, as measured by Endoflip technique. The Endoflip study requires placement of a bag inside the esophagus and distending it with saline to measure pressure and the bag luminal CSA. While Endoflip is an important advancement to measure the luminal CSA, it does not record distensibility under physiological condition of swallowing, i.e., swallow-induced peristalsis. Using intraluminal impedance technique, the investigators have pioneered a methodology to measure the luminal CSA during peristalsis. Using above methodology, the investigators found that in many participant groups, i.e., nutcracker esophagus, esophagogastric junction outflow obstruction and functional dysphagia, the luminal CSA during peristalsis is significantly smaller as compared to normal healthy subjects. The luminal CSA ahead of contraction during peristalsis is an indirect measure of the descending relaxation of the peristaltic reflex. Recent studies published in the New England Journal of Medicine and Gastroenterology show that a 24-week treatment with Dupilumab leads to an approximately 50% reduction in dysphagia symptoms, \\>90% reduction in the eosinophil count, 70% reduction in the histologic scoring system and 18% improvement in the esophageal distensibility. The goal of the study is to determine if treatment with Dupilumab will result in reversal of the longitudinal muscle dysfunction during peristalsis seen in patients with EOE.\n\nThe Dupilumab is an FDA approved study for the treatment of EOE. The current investigation is not intended to support, 1) a significant change in the advertising for the drug, 2) does not involve a change of route of administration, dose, participant population, or other factor that significantly increases the risk (or decreases the acceptability of the risk) associated with the use of the drug product. The investigation will be conducted in compliance with the requirements for review by an IRB and with the requirements for informed consent. 3) A previously reported study has showed a significant inflammation reduction in 60% EoE patients when taking Dupilumab for 12 weeks. This study aims to study its effects on restoring peristalsis in EoE participants when taken for 12 weeks. 4) Participants after study completion will be continuing standard treatment guidelines as indicated by the study PI or participant's physician."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE)"],"keywords":["Dupilumab","Dupixent","EoE","Eosinophilic esophagitis","Esophagitis","inflammation","Esophagus","Dysphagia","Difficulty swallowing","food stuck in throat","Motility","Gastroenterology"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"The study is a single arm clinical trial with subgroup analysis comparing responder's vs non-responders.

These types of immunotherapy study drugs are collectively known as immune checkpoint inhibitors. Immunotherapies are treatments that use the immune system to recognize and kill cancer cells. The study is focused on participants with a type of skin cancer known as melanoma.\n\nThe objective of this study is to see if the combination of fianlimab and cemiplimab is an effective treatment compared to cemiplimab in participants with high-risk, resectable melanoma. Participants will receive treatment before surgery, undergo resection, and then will have the option to continue treatment after resection.\n\nThe study is looking at several other research questions, including:\n\n* What side effects may happen from receiving the study drug(s).\n* How much study drug(s) is in the blood at different times.\n* Whether the body makes antibodies against the study drug(s) (which could make the drug less effective or could lead to side effects).

Patients without evidence of metastatic disease, with tissue remaining from a pre-treatment biopsy, and who are being considered for standard treatment by prostatectomy, will be invited to participate and will be on study for up to 15 months.","detailedDescription":"The original design of this protocol was to examine the use of a plasmid DNA vaccine encoding Androgen Receptor (AR), alone or with nivolumab, to induce and/or augment therapeutic T-cells following androgen deprivation in participants with newly diagnosed prostate cancer scheduled to undergo prostatectomy in one of three treatment arms. Based on emerging preclinical data that the timing of PD-1 blockade with the first immunization may be critical, and that combining PD-1 and LAG-3 blockade can improve the anti-tumor efficacy of vaccination in murine models of prostate cancer, the trial was amended to include two additional treatment arms testing the timing of PD-1 blockade and the addition of LAG-3 blockade. All participants will receive treatment with degarelix for 8 weeks prior to prostatectomy. In the first part of the study encompassing the first 3 treatment arms, participants will be also be randomized to receive either no additional treatment, a DNA vaccine encoding AR, or a DNA vaccine encoding AR and nivolumab. The additional arms will randomize patients to receive cemiplimab (PD-1 antagonist) with vaccine or cemiplimab with fianlimab (LAG-3 antagonist) and vaccine, with each agent initiated with the first immunization.\n\nParticipants receiving vaccination will begin that treatment prior to degarelix, based on preclinical findings that this may be a preferred sequence of treatment. The overall goal is to determine whether a DNA vaccine can augment the number of prostate tumor-specific infiltrating CD8+ T cells elicited with androgen deprivation, and whether this might be further augmented by combination with T-cell checkpoint blockade.\n\nBecause these cells should have cytolytic effector function, the primary clinical endpoint is pathological response (pCR and secondarily MRD) at the time of prostatectomy. This endpoint was chosen based on observations from previous clinical trials evaluating androgen deprivation therapies alone in this setting.\n\nSafety will also be a primary objective of the current study, as this vaccine and nivolumab have not been previously used in this early stage population. An additional secondary clinical endpoint will be 1-year PSA progression-free survival, after completion of all therapy, and with evidence of testosterone recovery.\n\nLaboratory and correlative endpoints will include whether vaccination, with or without concurrent T-cell checkpoint blockade, elicits greater numbers of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and whether AR-specific prostate tissue-infiltrating CD8+ T cells and persistent systemic immunity are detectable after treatment with vaccination. Other correlative studies will evaluate FLT PET/CT (Arms 1-3) as an investigational means of specifically identifying tumor infiltration by proliferating T cells as an early marker of treatment response, and whether uptake in other normal tissues is associated with autoimmune toxicity. While this is a relatively small trial, given a focus on correlative endpoints, a phase 2 expansion design was chosen to further evaluate the safety and clinical efficacy if pathological responses are observed in the initial part of the trial. If pathological responses exceeding 20% are observed, this will be considered significantly different from what has been historically observed, and would justify proceeding with future larger studies evaluating these combination approaches in the neoadjuvant stage of prostate cancer.\n\nPrimary Objectives:\n\n1. To evaluate the safety of androgen deprivation and pTVG-AR DNA vaccine, alone or in combination with T-cell checkpoint blockade, in patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer\n2. To determine if pathological complete responses or minimal residual disease (MRD) can occur in patients with prostate cancer treated with androgen deprivation and pTVG-AR, alone or in combination with T-cell checkpoint blockade, prior to definitive surgery\n\nSecondary Clinical Objective:\n\n1. To estimate 1-year PSA progression-free survival (post-prostatectomy)\n2.

Antibodies are proteins naturally found in the blood. A monoclonal antibody is a special antibody that is manufactured as a medication to target specific proteins in the body that may be involved in cancer. Cemiplimab works by blocking programmed death-1 (PD-1), a cell receptor on immune cells. By blocking PD-1, it is expected that the immune cells will attack cancer cells.\n\nThe study is being conducted in participants that have had surgery and radiation therapy for a type of skin cancer called cutaneous squamous cell cancer, and who have a risk that this cancer may come back.\n\nThe main purpose of the study is to determine if cemiplimab will prevent cutaneous squamous cell cancer (CSCC) from returning after surgery and radiation. Currently, we know that certain types of CSCC have a high chance of coming back after surgery and radiation. At this time, there is no approved treatment to give patients after surgery and radiation to prevent high-risk CSCC from coming back. We are investigating if the addition of cemiplimab will decrease the chance of these high-risk cancers coming back.\n\nThe study will also investigate if cemiplimab may help participants live for longer.\n\nThe study has two parts. Part 1: participants will receive every 3 weeks via intravenous infusion (drip into a vein) either cemiplimab (study drug) or placebo (similar to the study drug but without active medicine). After 12 weeks of treatment, cemiplimab or placebo will be given every 6 weeks. Part 1 of the study includes a screening period (up to 28 days), a treatment period (approximately 48 weeks), an end of treatment visit (approximately 30 days after completion of study drug treatment period) and a post-treatment follow-up period (approximately up to 5 years or until skin cancer returns or the study ends).\n\nPart 2 of the study is optional and provides the participant with the option to receive cemiplimab if the cancer comes back if the participant was initially receiving placebo. There is no placebo in Part 2 of the study. If the cancer comes back, the study doctor will discuss with participants if they are eligible to participate in the optional part 2 of the study.\n\nPart 2 of the study includes a brief screening period, a treatment period (approximately 96 weeks) and an end of treatment visit (approximately 30 days after the completion of the study drug treatment period)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma"],"keywords":["High risk"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":415,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cemiplimab","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Cemiplimab"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Cemiplimab","description":"Intravenous (IV) infusion over 30 minutes","armGroupLabels":["Cemiplimab"],"otherNames":["REGN2810","Libtayo"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"Intravenous (IV) infusion over 30 minutes","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"DFS defined as time from randomization to the first documented disease recurrence (local, regional and/or distant); or death due to any cause.","description":"For patients who do not have a tumor recurrence or death, DFS will be censored on the date of last disease assessment.","timeFrame":"Up to 54 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Overall survival (OS), defined as time from randomization to the date of death.

Part B and C of the study is focused on participants with obesity.\n\nThe aim of Part A of the study is to see how safe and tolerable the study drug is in healthy participants. The aim of Part B and Part C of the study is to see how safe and effective the study drug is when combined with Wegovy.\n\nParts A, B, and C of the study are looking at several other research questions, including:\n\n* What side effects may happen from taking the study drug\n* How much study drug is in the blood at different times\n* Whether the body makes antibodies against the study drug (which could make the drug less effective or could lead to side effects)","detailedDescription":"Part A Healthy Volunteers\n\nPart B and Part C (starts after treatment for Part A has completed)

The purpose of this study is to see if the study medication dupilumab helps prevent those with mild to moderate asthma from having increased asthma symptoms, after being exposed to an experimental rhinovirus inoculation. This is a study about dupilumab which is a drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of moderate to severe asthma. Dupilumab is a medication that blocks pathways that cause asthmatic inflammation in the lungs, leading to symptoms and worsening lung function. During this study, subjects will be given either dupilumab or placebo and will subsequently be exposed to the the \"common\" cold virus (rhinovirus). The virus that the investigators are using has been safely used before in many studies like this involving thousands of volunteers, and the safe use of the virus in this research study has been reviewed by the FDA. The investigators will track asthma symptoms during the study with lung function tests, questionnaires, specimen collection, biomarkers, and physical exams. For data analysis the investigators will assess the samples collected to determine changes in the treatment groups. The investigators will also asses the symptom scores and deviations from baseline measures for lung function.","detailedDescription":"Rhinovirus (RV) is responsible for up to 70-80% of asthmatic exacerbations in children and adolescents requiring urgent care or hospitalizations. Understanding the mechanism by which this otherwise relatively innocuous infection produces asthma exacerbations is essential towards mitigating these episodes. Two theories have been proposed to explain this phenomenon. One is that asthmatics have defective innate and adaptive immune responses to viral respiratory infections, leading to increased viral-associated pathology with an associated enhanced inflammatory response. An alternative - and not mutually exclusive - explanation is that RV indirectly exacerbates an ongoing allergic response to bystander allergens. Dupilumab blocks type 2 inflammatory responses and is known to prevent asthma exacerbations. It both attenuates the reduced innate immunity observed in asthmatics and also reduces the ability to engage a type 2 allergic inflammatory response to bystander allergens. Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that RV mediated worsening of asthma will be attenuated in the presence of dupilumab. This study examines cellular and molecular mediators of these interactions, which could help understand the intimate mechanism(s) underlying dupilumab's protective effect in asthmatics.\n\nA total of 60 patients with mild persistent asthma will be enrolled and randomized in this study (30 active treatment and 30 placebo).\n\nThe double-blind, randomized design minimizes any sources of bias. The placebo group provides a reference for the interpretation of study results, so the net effect of dupilumab could be discerned. The dupilumab dose regimen selected for this study (300 mg q2w after an initial loading dose of 600 mg) is consistent with the approved dose for patients with asthma. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of dupilumab on innate antiviral and type 2 inflammatory biomarkers, epithelial barrier repair, and adaptive immune responses following rhinovirus infection in asthmatic patients. The exploratory objectives include evaluating the effect of dupilumab in reducing the severity of rhinovirus-induced respiratory symptoms, its effect on lung function (eg FEV1, FEV1/FVC) and asthma control. As well as evaluating the effect of dupilumab on other biomarkers and viral load. The sample size was selected empirically, informed by similar successful studies conducted in the past. For example, in a previous double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial of omalizumab in the prevention of RV-induced asthma exacerbations, a total n of 20 (10 per group in the final analysis) was sufficient to achieve a secondary endpoint based on FEV1/FVC ratio). These data demonstrate the intrinsic power of the viral challenge model. The population included in the current trial has been further enriched (mild to moderate persistent asthmatics, on ICS ± other long-term controllers)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Asthma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Double-blind, Randomized study design.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","maskingDescription":"The placebo group provides a reference for the interpretation of study results, so the net effect of dupilumab could be discerned.","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Dupilumab","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The dupilumab dose regimen selected for this study (300 mg q2w after an initial loading dose of 600 mg)","interventionNames":["Drug: Dupilumab Injectable Product"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"A harmless substance that looks like the study drug, but which should have no effect.

Patients may have improved DME with anti-VEGF therapy and ranibizumab has been found to reduce central macular thickness (CMT) with anti-VEGF therapy following vitrectomy. Those patients still require intravitreal injections but the pharmacokinetics of a vitrectomized eye are different than those eyes that have not undergone vitrectomy. The clearance of protein molecules is quicker in vitrectomized eyes so these patients may be more refractory to standard of care anti-VEGF therapy. In rabbit models, the half-life of both bevacizumab and ranibizumab were reduced by a factor 1.8 and 1.3, respectively, after pars plana vitrectomy. In a study examining intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide in human eyes, the half-life was found to be 18.6 days in non-vitrectomized eyes and 3.2 days in vitrectomized eyes, but there was considerable intrasubject variation. Patients with various disease states, including neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) have been managed with monthly anti-VEGF therapy successfully after vitrectomy surgery. Another study performed by the DRCR net showed that patients with DME treated with anti-VEGF are not affected in the long term if they had had a previous vitrectomy. High dose aflibercept may improve anatomic and visual outcomes in this patient population. Also, high dose aflibercept may allow for longer treatment intervals in these vitrectomized eyes.","detailedDescription":"Patients with Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) and previous Pars Plana Vitrectomy (PPV) will be treated with a treat-extend-stop (TES) protocol that was previously published. Below is the description of the TES protocol published in the International Journal of Retina and Vitreous. This protocol was originally used in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) but it is being adapted for treatment of patients with DME in this study.\n\nPatients were treated following the treat-and-extend-stop (TES) protocol, which is a variant to the treat-and-extend regimen. The TES treatment protocol required 3 loading injections at 4-to-6-week treatment interval. Upon clinical examination and on Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), dosing interval was extended by 1 to 2 weeks in patients with dry macula. Any evidence of fluid on OCT and decreased vision was carefully monitored. If fluid or worsening of vision was detected, the dosing interval was reduced. After successful management of patients following decreased interval, patients were allowed to increase interval by 1 week for the next 2 to 4 injections. In patients with good response without worsening vision, but exhibiting presence of mild fluid during the initial 4 to 6 week treatment interval, the same interval was maintained. In patients with complete absence of fluid in the macula, dosing interval was extended by 1 to 2 weeks. Extension of dosing interval continued until 12 weeks was reached between visits. To avoid recurrence of fluid, patients were monitored carefully once the 12-week interval was reached. Patients who experienced deterioration of vision or increase in metamorphopsia were instructed to contact the office for earlier return visit.\n\nIn this study, patients that have had a previous vitrectomy and have DME will be treated with high dose aflibercept until fluid has resolved and then the time interval in between treatments for those patients will be extended, while maintaining a fluid-free macula.\n\n* VEGF Trap, 8 mg is intended for intravitreal administration.\n* VEGF Trap, 8 mg study drug will be provided in single-use vial\n* The appearance of the vial will be in clear glass 2R vial with 13 mm West 4432/50 gray stopper with FluroTec® coatings and 13 mm royal blue flip-off seal.\n* The formulation of the VEGF Trap, 8 mg is sterile, vialed VEGF Trap recombinant protein, 114.3mg/mL, in an aqueous buffered solution, pH 5.8, containing 50 mM arginine monohydrochloride, 10 mM histidine, 5% (w/v) sucrose, and 0.03% (w/v) polysorbate 20.\n* Store refrigerated at 2°C - 8°C (36°F - 46°F) in the original carton to protect from light.\n\nVisual acuity and CMT will be recorded prior to vitrectomy and prior to inclusion into the trial, after the PPV. Visual acuity and CMT will be recorded at each treatment visit. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) will also be assessed at the visit prior to inclusion using wide-field fundus photos (FP) and fluorescein angiography (FA). DR will also be assessed as a secondary endpoint at 6 months and at the one-year visit utilizing FP and FA\n\nStudy Duration\n\nThe study duration will be one-year of active treatment with high-dose aflibercept in patients with DME that have been previously vitrectomized.\n\nSafety Reporting including SAEs, AESI and Pregnancy\n\nSafety reports will be transmitted to post-approval surveillance, per usual protocol for phase 4 studies, including SAEs, AESIs and pregnancy. For SAEs, these will be reported to both post-approval surveillance, Regeneron and the ASRS ReST committee. SAEs would include death, cerebrovascular incidents, myocardial infarction, hospitalization and a decrease in vision over 6 lines. AESIs would include inflammatory events including uveitis and iritis, intraocular inflammation, retinal detachment/retinal tear, traumatic cataract, transient elevation in intraocular pressure requiring glaucoma surgery, or managed by greater than three new glaucoma drops. Efforts will be made to not include patients that are pregnant and those patients that are pregnant or are planning to become pregnant will be excluded.\n\nFurther safety reporting details are outlined as below. Safety Reporting i) Adverse Event Reporting. The Institution agrees that the Sponsor Investigator shall report the following safety information in connection with the Regeneron Product to Regeneron at medical.safety@regeneron.com within twenty-four (24) hours of awareness, and it shall be collected/recorded in English on the FDA MedWatch Form or other safety reporting form as applicable:\n\n1. All Serious Adverse Events (\"SAEs\") (regardless of causality) from the time of consent through 30 days of the last dose of the Regeneron Product (VEGF Trap, 8mg).\n\n   (a) SAEs as defined by FDA 21 CFR 312.32, which includes, for the avoidance of doubt, adverse events that: (i) are life-threatening, and/or (ii) result in (A) death, (B) in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, (C) persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or (D) a congenital anomaly or birth defect; and (b) all serious and/or nonserious reports of: (i) overdose, (ii) abuse, (iii) misuse, (iv) medication error (defined as an unintended failure in the drug treatment process that leads to, or has the potential to lead to, harm to the Study subject (for example, issues related to dispensing and administration which VEGF Trap, 8 mg (Aflibercept HD) - Protocol Guidance either (A) reach the Study subject or (B) are intercepted and never reached a Study subject, but had the potential to cause harm), (v) occupational exposure and/or (vi) lack of therapeutic efficacy.\n\n   (i) Symptomatic overdose (dose greater than 8 mg), including overdose due to medication error, i.e., error in prescription, administration, dispensing, dosage, unauthorized indication or population\n2. Adverse Events of Special Interest (\"AESIs\") occurring during the study (a) n/a for VEGF Trap, 8mg inflammatory events including uveitis and iritis, intraocular inflammation, retinal detachment/retinal tear, traumatic cataract, transient elevation in intraocular pressure requiring glaucoma surgery, or managed by greater than three new glaucoma drops.\n3. Pregnancy. (a) Any pregnancy occurring in a female Study subject \\[or female partner of a male Study subject\\], during the Study or within 120 days of the last dose of the Regeneron Product. (b) Any complication of pregnancy affecting a female Study subject \\[or female partner of a male Study subject\\], and/or fetus and/or newborn that meets the SAE criteria. (c) Outcomes for all such pregnancies.\n\nii) Safety Reporting Requirements to FDA. The Sponsor Investigator will record and report safety information in accordance with the Protocol and will report safety information to the FDA or local health authority in accordance with the applicable requirements. Additionally, all reports to the FDA or local health authority shall be reported to Regeneron. A detailed narrative summarizing the course of the event, including its evaluation, treatment, and outcome should be provided on the MedWatch Form or other reporting form as may be provided by Regeneron. Specific or estimated dates of event onset, treatment, and resolution should be included, when available. Medical history, concomitant medications, and laboratory data that are relevant to the event should also be summarized in the narrative. For fatal events, the narrative should state whether an autopsy was or will be performed and include the results if available. Information not available at the time of the initial report must be documented in a follow-up report. Source documents (including hospital or medical records, diagnostic reports, etc.) shall be summarized in the narrative on the FDA MedWatch Form or other reporting form as may be provided by Regeneron retained by the Sponsor Investigator and shall be available upon request.\n\nSAE Reporting Period:\n\nThe SAEs that are subject to this reporting provision are those that occur from time of informed consent through 30 days after discontinuation of the Regeneron product. SAEs that occur more than 30 days after discontinuation of the Regeneron product will be reported only if the investigator believes the study drug caused the AE/SAE.\n\nSafety Reporting Mailbox: medical.safety@regeneron.com\n\nStatistical Considerations including the sample size justification\n\nFifteen patients would be planned to be included in this phase 4 study. This should provide statistical power to assess visual acuity improvements and CMT decrease from baseline interval between high dose aflibercept therapy. This should also allow for enough power to compare both PK data and cytokines levels in patients, with and without vitrectomy, with DME Statistical analysis would be two-armed students paired t-testing and ANOVA testing."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)"],"keywords":["diabetic macular edema","diabetes","type 1 diabetes","type 2 diabetes","Diabetic Retinopathy","anti-VEGF","aflibercept","aflibercept 8 mg","vitrectomy","proliferative diabetic retinopathy","non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Identify patients that have had a previous vitrectomy and have DME that requires anti-VEGF therapy.
