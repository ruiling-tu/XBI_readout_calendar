This system has however not been specifically studied to look at its ability to prevent hair loss in patients specifically receiving sacituzumab govitecan, trastuzumab deruxtecan, or eribulin.\n\nThe research study procedures include: screening for eligibility, photographs, hair loss assessments, questionnaires and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits.\n\nParticipants will receive study treatment with scalp cooling with standard of care chemotherapy treatment and will be followed for 2-4 weeks after completion of treatment with chemotherapy.\n\nIt is expected that about 120 people will take part in this research study.\n\nPaxman Coolers Limited is a medical device company and is supporting this research study by providing access to the investigational device, Paxman Scalp Cooling System."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Metastatic Breast Cancer","Chemotherapy-induced Alopecia"],"keywords":["Metastatic Breast Cancer","Chemotherapy-induced
