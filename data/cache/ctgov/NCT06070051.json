Those assigned to Cohort 1a will receive a low dose prime therapeutic vaccination of vector AdC7 on Day 1, followed by a booster vaccination on Day 91 using vector AdC6. Those assigned to Cohort 1b will receive a low dose prime therapeutic vaccination of vector AdC6 on Day 1, and will not receive a booster vaccination.\n\nGroup 2 will then enroll approximately 24 participants randomized to Cohort 2a or Cohort 2b. Those assigned to Cohort 2a will receive a high dose prime therapeutic vaccination of vector AdC7 on Day 1, followed by a booster vaccination on Day 91 using vector AdC6. Those assigned to Cohort 2b will receive a high dose prime therapeutic vaccination of vector AdC6 on Day 1, and will not receive a booster vaccination.\n\nGroup 3 will enroll approximately 8 participants randomized into Cohort 3a or Cohort 3b. Cohort 3a will receive the high dose prime VRON-0200 vaccination of vector AdC7 on Day 1, followed by doses of VIR-2218 plus VIR-3434 on Days 28, 56, 84, 112, 140 and 168, and then a booster using a high dose VRON-0200 vaccination of vector AdC6 on Day 196. Cohort 3b will receive the same high dose prime VRON-0200 vaccination of vector AdC7 followed by 6 doses of VIR-2218 plus VIR-3434 at the same timepoints as Cohort 3a, but will not receive the booster dose on Day 196.\n\nVRON-0200 vaccine doses will be administered by intramuscular (IM) injection. VIR-2218 and VIR-3434 will be administered subcutaneously.\n\nAll study participants will be followed for a total of 1 year post-prime vaccination."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Hepatitis B"],"keywords":["Hep B","Chronic Hep B","HBV","Hepatitis B Virus","Chronic Hepatitis B Virus","CHB","VRON-0200","Virion","therapeutic vaccine","VIR-2218","VIR-3434","Functional cure","Hepatitis B","Chronic Hepatitis B"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":56,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cohort 1a: Low Dose VRON-0200-AdC7 Prime, VRON-0200-AdC6 Boost","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants assigned to Cohort 1a will receive a low dose prime vaccination of AdC7 vector on Day 1.
