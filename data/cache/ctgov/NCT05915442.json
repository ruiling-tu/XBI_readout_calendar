Hence, methods to improve the local curative potential of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a timely and important opportunity. In addition, previous data suggest that the adenosine A2A pathway may be a particularly attractive avenue for intervention in the context of radiation, thus influencing multiple suppressive populations within the tumor microenvironment (TME).\n\nImmunotherapy based on the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling axis is a mainstay of therapy across multiple types of malignancies. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a PD-1 inhibitor (zimberelimab) in combination with a selective dual antagonist of A2aR and A2bR (etrumadenant) and an anti-CD73 (quemliclustat). Immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted inhibitors of the adenosine signaling axis modulate the TME and aspects of the systemic immune system to overcome tumor-induced immune suppression and improve responses to therapy.\n\nThis study aims to determine the effect of etrumadenant, quemliclustat and zimberelimab \\[experimental\\] when given with ablative radiation (SBRT)\\[standard of care\\] on the oligoprogressive disease (hormone sensitive oligometastatic prostate cancer), defined by being free from radiographic progression of irradiated target metastases and PSA (prostate surface antigen) response at 6 months. PSA response, local control, progression-free survival (PFS), treatment response, ADT-free survival, time-to-pain, and safety and tolerability will also be measured. By employing a Simon Two-Stage design, the trial will test whether or not etrumadenant + quemliclustat and zimberelimab combined with ablative radiation (SBRT) will improve PFS compared to SBRT alone (ORIOLE)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer"],"keywords":["Adenosine Signaling","AB680","AB928","AB122","Quemliclustatm","Etrumadenant","Zimberelimab"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","interventionModelDescription":"Simon Two-Stage design: In the first stage, trial will enroll 14 patients.

Male participants with female partners of childbearing potential are required to use highly effective contraceptive measures which include condom use. A man is considered fertile after puberty unless permanently sterile by bilateral orchidectomy.

A high follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.\n\n    Highly effective contraceptive measures include:\n    * Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: oral, intravaginal, transdermal\n    * Progestogen only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: oral, injectable, implantable\n    * Intrauterine device\n    * Intrauterine hormone-releasing system\n    * Surgical sterilization\n    * The male participant is vasectomized (with documented medical confirmation of surgical success) and is the sole sexual partner of the WOCBP participant\n    * Female partner of the male participant has undergone bilateral tubal ligation\n    * Complete sexual abstinence defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with study treatment.
