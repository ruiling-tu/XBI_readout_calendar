This will be followed by consolidation chemotherapy (weeks 3-20) with mFOLFOX x9 cycles in combination with AB928 and AB122. Patients will thereafter be assessed for therapeutic responses (week 22-24) with a digital rectal examination, pelvic MRI, and endoscopy. Each case will be reviewed by the Weill Cornell Medicine Colorectal Multidisciplinary Tumor Board for consensus agreement regarding clinical treatment response. The patients thereafter will proceed with total mesorectal excision (TME, week 24) by transabdominal resection for pathologic evaluation (primary tumor and pelvic lymph nodes will be examined)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Rectal Cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":43,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Radiation therapy and etrumadenant (AB928)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Enrolled patients will receive Radiation therapy of 25 Gy in 5 fractions along with etrumadenant 150mg oral drug taken once daily. this will then be followed by 9 cycles of FOLFOX in combination of etrumadenant and zimberelimab investigational drugs.","interventionNames":["Drug: Etrumadenant (AB928)","Radiation: Radiation therapy","Drug: FOLFOX regimen","Drug: Zimberelimab (AB122)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Etrumadenant (AB928)","description":"Patients will receive a radiation therapy dose of 25Gy in 5 fractions in combination with etrumadenant 150 mg orally, once daily as part of a continuous dose regimen.","armGroupLabels":["Radiation therapy and etrumadenant (AB928)"]},{"type":"RADIATION","name":"Radiation therapy","description":"Patients will receive a radiation therapy dose of 25Gy in 5fx","armGroupLabels":["Radiation therapy and etrumadenant (AB928)"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"FOLFOX regimen","description":"After completing the radiation therapy, patients will receive FOLFOX regimen for 9 cycles in combination with etrumadenant and zimberelimab.
