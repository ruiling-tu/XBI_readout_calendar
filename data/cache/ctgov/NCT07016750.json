During the second intervention period subjects will receive the alternative IP for an additional 12 weeks. IP will be administered in the home setting by a healthcare provider. The Investigator (or designee) will contact subjects (or their parent/legal guardian) to assess for any adverse events or changes in medications, treatments, or procedures. Subjects (or their parent/legal guardian) will complete weekly symptom diaries and monthly questionnaires to document corneal abrasion symptoms and frequency and gauge overall subject (or parent/legal guardian) impressions of disease severity and disease/symptom changes during the study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa","DEB - Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa","Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa","Dominant Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa"],"keywords":["Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa","DEB","Corneal Abrasions"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":16,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"KB803","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"KB803","interventionNames":["Biological: KB803"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Vehicle","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"KB803","description":"Ophthalmic suspension of replication-defective, non-integrating herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) expressing the human collagen VII protein","armGroupLabels":["KB803"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"Vehicle","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"To evaluate the safety and tolerability of KB803.","description":"Number of subjects with treatment related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.","timeFrame":"24 weeks"},{"measure":"To evaluate the effect of ophthalmic KB803 versus placebo on frequency of corneal. abrasion symptoms.","description":"Change from baseline in average number of days per month with corneal abrasion symptoms.","timeFrame":"24 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"To evaluate the effect of ophthalmic KB803 versus placebo on eye pain.","description":"Change from baseline in average weekly eye pain score.\n\nPain will be measured using a numerical scale with 0 being no hurt through 10 being the worst hurt.","timeFrame":"24 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
