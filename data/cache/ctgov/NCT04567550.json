DR is a chronic and progressive complication of diabetes mellitus. It is a sight-threatening disease characterized in the early stages by neuronal and vascular dysfunction in the retina, and later by neovascularization that leads to further deterioration of functional vision. Despite the availability of current treatments, diabetic retinopathy remains the leading cause of vision loss in working-age adults, those between the ages of 20 and 74. Existing treatment with anti-VEGF agents, although shown to be effective, are limited by short therapeutic half-lives, which then require frequent intravitreal injections over the patient's lifetime, resulting in increased risk of associated adverse events and significant treatment burden. Due to the burden of treatment, patients often do not closely adhere to treatment regimens and experience sub-optimal outcomes and a decline in vision.","detailedDescription":"This phase 2, randomized, dose-escalation study is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ABBV-RGX-314 gene therapy in subjects with DR with and without center-involved diabetic macular edema (CI-DME).\n\nPart 1: For subjects with DR without CI-DME, approximately 100 participants who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled into one of 5 cohorts. Participants will be randomized in Cohorts 1, 2, 4 and 5 to receive ABBV-RGX-314 or to be observed, and participants enrolled in Cohort 3 will receive ABBV-RGX-314. Cohort 1 will evaluate ABBV-RGX-314 Dose 1, Cohorts 2 and 3 will evaluate ABBV-RGX-314 Dose 2, and Cohorts 4 and 5 will evaluate ABBV-RGX-314 Dose 3. Following SCS ABBV-RGX-314 administration, participants in Cohorts 4 and 5 will receive a protocol-mandated post-procedure steroid regimen for 7 weeks. Participants who are randomized to be observed in Cohorts 1, 2, 4 and 5 will be offered ABBV-RGX-314 after completing the study.\n\nPart 2: For subjects with DR with CI-DME, approximately 30 participants who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled into one cohort (Cohort A). Participants will be randomized to receive ABBV-RGX-314 or Aflibercept Control. Cohort A will evaluate ABBV-RGX-314 Dose 4. Participants randomized to receive SCS ABBV-RGX-314 will receive a protocol-mandated course of steroid. Participants who are randomized to the Aflibercept Control arm will be offered ABBV-RGX-314 after completing the study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)","Center-Involved
