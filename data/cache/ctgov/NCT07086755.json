Data will be reported as a Win Ratio, which quantifies the relative benefit of treatment compared to control. The Win Ratio is calculated from all pairwise comparisons of each patient in the treatment group compared with each patient in the control group, using the following formula: Win Ratio = Number of Wins/Number of Losses. Number of Wins is defined as: The count of pairs where the treatment group patient has a better outcome than the control group patient.
