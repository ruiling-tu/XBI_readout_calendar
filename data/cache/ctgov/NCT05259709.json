The study is focused on patients with a type of cancer that can be potentially imaged using 89Zr-DFO-REGN5054 and show special tumor features that may be important to the way the immune system fights cancer.\n\nThe aim of the study is to study the safety and tolerability (how the body reacts to the drug) of the imaging agent 89Zr-DFO REGN5054.\n\nThe study is looking at several other research questions, including:\n\n* What side effects may happen from taking the study drugs\n* How much study drug is in the blood at different times\n* Whether the body makes antibodies against the study drugs (which could make the study drugs less effective or could lead to side effects)"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Advanced Solid Tumor","Metastatic Solid Tumor"],"keywords":["Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan","Immuno-PET"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Single ascending dose of 89Zr˗DFO˗REGN5054 followed by fixed dose of cemiplimab","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Part A:\n\nDoses of 89Zr˗DFO˗REGN5054 may be reduced based upon assessment.","interventionNames":["Drug: 89Zr˗DFO˗REGN5054","Drug: cemiplimab"]},{"label":"Defined dose of 89Zr˗DFO˗REGN5054 followed by fixed dose of cemiplimab","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Part B:\n\nDefined dose of 89Zr˗DFO˗REGN5054 determined in Part A.","interventionNames":["Drug: 89Zr˗DFO˗REGN5054","Drug: cemiplimab"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"89Zr˗DFO˗REGN5054","description":"Administered by intravenous (IV) infusion during Part A and B.","armGroupLabels":["Defined dose of 89Zr˗DFO˗REGN5054 followed by fixed dose of cemiplimab","Single ascending dose of 89Zr˗DFO˗REGN5054 followed by fixed dose of cemiplimab"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"cemiplimab","description":"Administered by IV infusion every 3 weeks (Q3W).","armGroupLabels":["Defined dose of 89Zr˗DFO˗REGN5054 followed by fixed dose of cemiplimab","Single ascending dose of 89Zr˗DFO˗REGN5054 followed by fixed dose of cemiplimab"],"otherNames":["REGN2810","Libtayo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs)","description":"Part A","timeFrame":"Up to day 8, after the infusion of 89Zr˗DFO˗REGN5054"},{"measure":"Incidence and severity of TEAEs","description":"Part A and B","timeFrame":"Up to approximately week 115"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Clinical dosimetry based on tissue radiation absorbed dose calculated from positron emission tomography (PET) image acquisition data","description":"After injection of 37 megabecquerel (MBq) of 89Zr-DFO-REGN5054, a series of whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) images will be obtained over a period of up to 8 days and corrected for attenuation by low-dose computed tomography (CT) scans using PET/CT.
