Mutations must be reviewed and approved by a variant classification committee.\n3. Upright (sitting position) slow vital capacity (SVC) is ≥ 50% of predicted value (as adjusted for sex, age, and height) OR if SVC is \\< 50% of predicted value, must be 10 to 30 years of age (inclusive) at the time of informed consent AND had ALS symptom onset within 12 months before the time of informed consent.\n4.

Uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure \\[BP\\] \\> 160/100 millimeters of mercury \\[mm Hg\\]).\n6. Malignancy within 1 year before Screening, except for basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix that has been successfully treated.

Obstructive hydrocephalus\n8. Known significant brain or spinal disease that would interfere with the lumbar puncture (LP) process, CSF circulation or safety assessment, including tumors or abnormalities by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography, subarachnoid hemorrhage, suggestion of raised intracranial pressure on MRI or ophthalmic examination, spinal stenosis or curvature, Chiari malformation, syringomyelia, tethered spinal cord syndrome and connective tissue disorders such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Marfan syndrome.\n9. Concurrent participation in any other interventional clinical study.\n10. Previous or current treatment with an oligonucleotide (including small interfering RNA \\[siRNA\\], tofersen).

Anticipated need, in the opinion of the Investigator, for administration of any antiplatelet or anticoagulant medication that cannot be safely paused before and/or after an LP procedure according to local or institutional guidelines and/or Investigator determination after consultation with the appropriate treating physician. Low-dose aspirin (≤ 100 mg/day, administered as monotherapy) is permitted and may be continued through the LP procedure.\n14. Have any other conditions, which, in the opinion of the Investigator would make the participant unsuitable for inclusion or could interfere with the individual participating in or completing the study, in the opinion of the Investigator.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"10 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"University of California San Diego","city":"La Jolla","state":"California","zip":"92037","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":32.84727,"lon":-117.2742}},{"facility":"Stanford University Medical Center","city":"Palo Alto","state":"California","zip":"94304","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":37.44188,"lon":-122.14302}},{"facility":"Johns Hopkins University","city":"Baltimore","state":"Maryland","zip":"21205","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":39.29038,"lon":-76.61219}},{"facility":"Massachusetts General Hospital","city":"Boston","state":"Massachusetts","zip":"02114","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":42.35843,"lon":-71.05977}},{"facility":"Washington University School of Medicine","city":"St Louis","state":"Missouri","zip":"63110","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":38.62727,"lon":-90.19789}},{"facility":"Columbia University Medical Center","city":"New York","state":"New York","zip":"10032","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":40.71427,"lon":-74.00597}},{"facility":"The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center","city":"Columbus","state":"Ohio","zip":"43210","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":39.96118,"lon":-82.99879}},{"facility":"University of Utah","city":"Salt Lake City","state":"Utah","zip":"84132","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":40.76078,"lon":-111.89105}},{"facility":"UZ Leuven","city":"Leuven","state":"VL-Brabant","zip":"3000","country":"Belgium","geoPoint":{"lat":50.87959,"lon":4.70093}},{"facility":"PSEG Centro de Pesquisa Clinica S.A.","city":"São Paulo","zip":"04038-002","country":"Brazil","geoPoint":{"lat":-23.5475,"lon":-46.63611}},{"facility":"Montreal Neurological Institute","city":"Montreal","state":"Quebec","zip":"H3A 2B4","country":"Canada","geoPoint":{"lat":45.50884,"lon":-73.58781}},{"facility":"Universitaetsmedizin Rostock","city":"Rostock","zip":"18147","country":"Germany","geoPoint":{"lat":54.0887,"lon":12.14049}},{"facility":"Universitätsklinikum Ulm","city":"Ulm","zip":"89081","country":"Germany","geoPoint":{"lat":48.39841,"lon":9.99155}},{"facility":"St. James Hospital","city":"Dublin","zip":"D08 A978","country":"Ireland","geoPoint":{"lat":53.33306,"lon":-6.24889}},{"facility":"Citta della Salute e della Scienza di Torino - Ospedale le Molinette","city":"Torino","zip":"10126","country":"Italy","geoPoint":{"lat":44.88856,"lon":11.99138}},{"facility":"Toho University Omori Medical Center","city":"Tokyo","zip":"143-8541","country":"Japan","geoPoint":{"lat":35.6895,"lon":139.69171}},{"facility":"Universitair Medisch Centrum Utrecht","city":"Utrecht","zip":"3584 CX","country":"Netherlands","geoPoint":{"lat":52.09083,"lon":5.12222}},{"facility":"Linden spólka z ograniczona odpowiedzialnoscia spólka komandytow","city":"Krakow","zip":"30-721","country":"Poland","geoPoint":{"lat":50.06143,"lon":19.93658}},{"facility":"Seoul National University Hospital","city":"Seoul","zip":"3080","country":"South Korea","geoPoint":{"lat":37.566,"lon":126.9784}},{"facility":"Hanyang University Seoul Hospital","city":"Seoul","zip":"4763","country":"South Korea","geoPoint":{"lat":37.566,"lon":126.9784}},{"facility":"Hospital Universitari de Bellvitge","city":"Barcelona","zip":"8907","country":"Spain","geoPoint":{"lat":41.38879,"lon":2.15899}},{"facility":"University Hospital of Umea","city":"Umeå","zip":"SE-901 85","country":"Sweden","geoPoint":{"lat":63.82842,"lon":20.25972}},{"facility":"Kantonsspital St. Gallen","city":"Sankt Gallen","zip":"9007","country":"Switzerland","geoPoint":{"lat":47.42391,"lon":9.37477}},{"facility":"Taipei Veterans General Hospital (VGHTP)","city":"Taipei","zip":"11217","country":"Taiwan","geoPoint":{"lat":25.05306,"lon":121.52639}},{"facility":"King's College Hospital","city":"London","zip":"SE5 9RT","country":"United Kingdom","geoPoint":{"lat":51.50853,"lon":-0.12574}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"35246398","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Codron P, Cassereau J, Vourc'h P.
