This will be conducted by examining the effect of a 48 week therapy with dupilumab on the rate of asthma exacerbations.","detailedDescription":"This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled parallel-group phase 4 clinical trial.\n\nPatients will be genotyped and categorized as those with: 1) the wild type allele (Q576/Q576), 2) heterozygous allele (Q576/R576), or 3) homozygous mutant allele (R576/R576); the genotype associated with more severe disease.\n\nAfter a run-in period of 2-12 weeks to determine asthma control, subjects who fulfill all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized to receive either subcutaneous Dupilumab or placebo (1:1 randomization allocation ratio).\n\nThis study addresses fundamental mechanisms by which the IL-4Rα-R576 variant drives the TH2/TH17 disease endotype and the influence of this variant on response to Dupilumab therapy. It brings together individuals with deep clinical and scientific expertise in allergic diseases, including epidemiology, genetics, inflammation, and tolerance mechanisms to investigate, in a coordinated strategy, the hypothesis that the IL-4Rα-R576 variant drives TH2/TH17 cell inflammation by subverting allergen-specific iTreg cells into TH17 cells. Asthmatics bearing this endotype will be particularly likely to favorably respond to Dupilumab therapy by virtue of its prevention of iTreg cell reprogramming into TH17-like cells, potentially leading to their long-term stability and potential for sustained immune tolerance."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Asthma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"This is a genotype stratified, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase IV clinical trial","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","maskingDescription":"Double blind, placebo controlled.","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":150,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treatment group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Dupilumab (Dupixent®) administered subcutaneously every two weeks.
