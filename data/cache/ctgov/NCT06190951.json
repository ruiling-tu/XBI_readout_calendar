These types of immunotherapy study drugs are collectively known as immune checkpoint inhibitors. Immunotherapies are treatments that use the immune system to recognize and kill cancer cells. The study is focused on participants with a type of skin cancer known as melanoma.\n\nThe objective of this study is to see if the combination of fianlimab and cemiplimab is an effective treatment compared to cemiplimab in participants with high-risk, resectable melanoma. Participants will receive treatment before surgery, undergo resection, and then will have the option to continue treatment after resection.\n\nThe study is looking at several other research questions, including:\n\n* What side effects may happen from receiving the study drug(s).\n* How much study drug(s) is in the blood at different times.\n* Whether the body makes antibodies against the study drug(s) (which could make the drug less effective or could lead to side effects). Antibodies are proteins that are naturally found in the blood stream that fight infections.\n* How administering the study drugs might improve quality of life."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Melanoma"],"keywords":["Skin cancer","Fully resectable stage III melanoma","Fully resectable stage IV melanoma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":151,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm A","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"As described in the protocol","interventionNames":["Drug: cemiplimab","Drug: Placebo"]},{"label":"Arm B","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"As described in the protocol","interventionNames":["Drug: Fixed Dose Combination (FDC) cemiplimab+fianlimab"]},{"label":"Arm C","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"As described in the protocol","interventionNames":["Drug: Fixed Dose Combination (FDC) cemiplimab+fianlimab"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"cemiplimab","description":"Administered per the protocol","armGroupLabels":["Arm A"],"otherNames":["REGN2810","Libtayo"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Fixed Dose Combination (FDC) cemiplimab+fianlimab","description":"Or coadministration, depending on availability.","armGroupLabels":["Arm B","Arm C"],"otherNames":["REGN2810","Libtayo","REGN3767"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"Administered per the protocol","armGroupLabels":["Arm A"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Pathological complete response (pCR) rate as assessed by Blinded Independent Pathological Review (BIPR)","timeFrame":"Up to 1 year"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"pCR rate as assessed by local pathologic review","timeFrame":"Up to 1 year"},{"measure":"Event-Free Survival (EFS)","timeFrame":"Up to 4 years"},{"measure":"Distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS)","timeFrame":"Up to 4 years"},{"measure":"Overall survival (OS)","timeFrame":"Up to 4 years"},{"measure":"Major pathological response (MPR) as assessed by BIPR","timeFrame":"Up to 4 years"},{"measure":"MPR rate as assessed by local pathologic review","timeFrame":"Up to 4 years"},{"measure":"Objective Response Rate (ORR) assessed by investigator per RECIST 1.1 criteria","timeFrame":"Up to 4 years"},{"measure":"ORR assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) per RECIST 1.1 criteria","timeFrame":"Up to 4 years"},{"measure":"Relapse-free survival (RFS)","timeFrame":"Up to 4 years"},{"measure":"Occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs)","timeFrame":"90 days following last dose of study drug, approximately 4 years"},{"measure":"Occurrence of immune-mediated adverse events (imAEs)","timeFrame":"90 days following last dose of study drug, approximately 4 years"},{"measure":"Occurrence of serious adverse events (SAEs)","timeFrame":"90 days following last dose of study drug, approximately 4 years"},{"measure":"Occurrence of adverse events of special interest (AESIs)","timeFrame":"90 days following last dose of study drug, approximately 4 years"},{"measure":"Occurrence of TEAEs resulting in death","timeFrame":"90 days following last dose of study drug, approximately 4 years"},{"measure":"Occurrence of interruption or discontinuation of study drug(s) due to TEAE.","timeFrame":"90 days following last dose of study drug, approximately 4 years"},{"measure":"Occurrence of cancellation of surgery due to TEAE or delay to surgery","timeFrame":"90 days following last dose of study drug, approximately 4 years"},{"measure":"Occurrence of laboratory abnormalities","description":"Grade 3 or higher per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE V5.0)","timeFrame":"90 days following last dose of study drug, approximately 4 years"},{"measure":"Concentrations of fianlimab in serum","timeFrame":"Up to 4 years"},{"measure":"Concentrations of cemiplimab in serum","timeFrame":"Up to 4 years"},{"measure":"Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) in serum to fianlimab","timeFrame":"Up to 4 years"},{"measure":"ADA in serum to cemiplimab","timeFrame":"Up to 4 years"},{"measure":"Change from baseline in disease-related symptoms per Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Melanoma (FACT-M) subscale","description":"The FACT-M is a melanoma-specific quality of life questionnaire that is composed of items from the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G).
